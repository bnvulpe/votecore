Many of then would readily say that it's saintly to show mercy and be kind to other people, but just aren't ever prompted to consider how their ither values contradict those statements. And if you do point out a values conflict, the natural reaction of all humans is to lash out at the one causing you discomfort, not to reassess your identities and values and find some new equilibrium through sober, intellectual consideration - that takes a lot of time and preparation and skill, which most people aren't encouraged to develop in an increasingly dire social and economic environment."}
