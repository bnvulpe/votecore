Basically, the Committee comes to a complete stand still as soon as one member demands individual interviews of each candidate, instead of agreeing to just rubber stamp the Biden list of recommendations. Tuberville held out around 8 months last time from what I recall. At this point, I think that Biden is done appointing federal judges.\n\nThe other steps listed will depend on how many GOP members of the House and Senate that they can convince to join. The initial letter had 8 Senators. Other GOP members have been joining enthusiastically since then, but I am waiting for someone to compile a comprehensive list. At a minimum, it appears that Biden or the democrats' odds of passing further legislation are quite challenging.\n\nInterestingly, they also intend to cut off future funds to the Biden White House, stopping the already many many millions of taxpayer dollars they have spent on lawfare against Trump. Most of this was paid to big private law firms to assist the prosecutors. Judge Cannon recently released a treasure trove of discovery proving the White House's extreme involvement in that case, including paying outside law firms to assist. Now the GOP is vowing to stop it, with quite likely tens of millions in outstanding legal fees, that Biden will have to pull from other pet projects to pay.\n\nThe separation of powers is working as intended. Congress has the power of the purse to reign in a tyrannical despot. \"No more money\" works as well with Presidents as it does with teenagers.

It happens.   \n  \nHush money until recently was par for the course (Eg. Bill Clinton paid Paula Jones $850,000 in the 90s compared to $130,000 to Stormy). NDAs are so common I\u2019d be shocked if most people hadn\u2019t signed one.  \n  \nFast forward.  \n  \nOur Founding Fathers were very worried about enforcing laws ex post facto (after the fact).  \n  \nThey also placed great emphasis on protecting property because they came from countries where, if you spoke up, the government would just take everything.  \n  \nNow we look at Trump.   \n  \nHis political opponents took a misdemeanor that no court or lawyer would touch for almost a decade because it was a Nothing Burger.   \n  \nWhat little was there had passed the statute of limitations.  \n  \nWhat did they do?   \n  \nThey resurrected essentially a bookkeeping charge as a felony, then tried an alleged federal crime in a biased STATE court, and made sure Trump was NOT in a court of his peers (that pesky Bill of Rights).  \n  \nThis would be like charging Nancy Pelosi in a deep red West Texas courtroom then claiming she was judged by her peers.  \n  \n\\*\\*\\*This has by and large been why America has held to the custom of not going after former Presidents criminally. It\u2019s literally impossible to get an unbiased jury.  \n  \nWe know this is bullshit. They know it\u2019s bullshit.  \n  \nProblem is\u2026it\u2019s radioactive bullshit that just punched a trillion unseen holes in ALL our freedoms    \n  \nThen the civil fraud case in NY where Trump lost and was ordered to pay a gazillion dollars in damages when there were no victims and even Deutsche Bank was repaid. CNN legal experts said this was a bad move.  \n  \nConstitutional violation.  \n  \nWhat does this mean? For you? For me? For America?  \n  \nAmerican law is based off English Common Law, which is why one must ALWAYS be very careful about what precedents any case sets b/c once one sets a PRECEDENT it\u2019s almost impossible to put the genie back in the bottle.  \n  \nNow?  \n  \nPolitical opponents or any business person (or regular citizen) who refuses to comply with whoever has the biggest stick?  \n  \nThe message is clear.   \n  \nIt\u2019s open season. They\u2019ll take all you have and JAIL you if you dare stand in the way.  \n  \nWho will want to run for office? Who would dare build a business in America? If you cross the wrong agenda and THIS can be done to you?  \n  \nAnd parties shift. Sure my generation and those close to my age respect the rule of law and believe in what America was and is supposed to be.  \n  \nBut it\u2019s pretty common knowledge that the successive generations push the boundaries much farther.  \n  \nLook at the college campuses. NOW, look at what the Left just handed to a generation of very angry, very entitled young people who have no respect for the rule of law.  \n  \nWhen will you cease to be \u201cradical\u201d enough?  \n  \nThis is why, since time immemorial, witch hunts never ended well.

DeSantis Kills Hemp Bill, Thus Keeping Delta-8 and Related Compounds Legal: Gov.

The bill sought to limit the concentration of delta-9 THC---a psychoactive compound found in cannabis plants---in hemp extracts and prohibit several other non-CBD (cannabidiol) compounds. These compounds interact with the brain\u2019s CB1 receptors, which are part of the endocannabinoid system involved in regulating various physiological processes.\n\nGovernor DeSantis\u2019s decision is depicted as a win for the hemp industry and small businesses. He expressed concerns that the bill would place excessive regulatory burdens on small enterprises and disrupt the market without achieving its intended goals. Instead, he called for \u201csensible, non-arbitrary regulation\u201d that would provide stability to the industry while ensuring consumer safety.\n\nThe bill would have set a cap on delta-9 THC at 5 milligrams per serving or 50 milligrams per container, affecting products like hemp extracts that are used for their therapeutic benefits. It also aimed to ban compounds such as delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol, delta-10-tetrahydrocannabinol, and others, which are chemically similar to THC but are derived from hemp.\n\nThe vetoed bill followed previous legislation (SB 1676) passed in 2023, which established age restrictions and packaging guidelines to prevent minors from accessing hemp edibles. The new bill was part of a broader trend of states imposing bans on certain hemp products, against the backdrop of potential federal restrictions.\n\nGovernor DeSantis\u2019s veto has been praised by industry leaders, who view it as a protective measure for Florida\u2019s regulated hemp market, small businesses, and jobs. They emphasize the need for a regulatory framework that balances safety with economic freedom.\n\n\n\n**TERM EXPLANATIONS:**\n\nHemp: A variety of the Cannabis sativa plant species, grown primarily for industrial use. Unlike marijuana, it contains low levels of THC.\n\nDelta-9 THC: The main psychoactive component of cannabis, responsible for the \u2018high\u2019 feeling.\n\nCBD: A non-psychoactive compound in cannabis, often used for its potential health benefits without causing a high.\n\nCB1 Receptors: Part of the nervous system that interacts with cannabinoids, influencing mood, appetite, and pain sensation.\n\nPsychoactive: A substance that affects the mind, mood, or behavior.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1dbhkh1/title_gov_desantis_kills_hemp_bill_thus_keeping/"}

Elections are referendums on the incumbent.  The incumbent has a terrible record.  Hammer on it, especially on the economy and illegal immigration.\n\n2. Unlike most challengers, you have a record of your own in office.  Remind everyone of what they were paying for gas and milk when you were in charge.  This is an economy election.\n\n3.  While you do want to remind voters of what they liked about your term, you don't want to remind them of what they didn't like.  Don't yell.  Don't interrupt excessively.  Your supporters all know that you are a fighter.  The swing voters want to see you act like a president.  You probably lost the election with the disastrous \"yell at the old man\" debate in 2020.  Don't repeat it.\n\n4.  The moderators, Biden, or (most likely) all of them are going to hammer the NY conviction.  Feel free to talk about it being a political hit job.  Don't claim innocence.  Everyone knows you paid Stormy off.  Most people don't care.  You an also bring up that Biden's special prosecutor didn't recommend charges against him because he's too old and diminished to stand trial.\n\n5. Everyone who thinks the 2020 election was stolen is already going to vote for you.  There is no need to even mention it.  If you are asked, just say you are focused on winning this year.  The only reminders people want from your first term are the good things.  \n\n6.  Feel free to bring up Biden's diminished mental capacity.  But do it in a way that makes it sound like you feel sorry for him.  He will get mad.  Let him start yelling.  The voters already wonder if he is still in control.   Let them see that he's not.  As soon as a presidential candidate has to argue that he didn't poop his pants during a D-Day memorial, he's lost the election.\n\n7.  But don't count on Biden looking like a dementia ward patient during the debate.  He will be hopped up on all the stimulants the pharmaceutical industry has to offer.  But a \"Why did Barack Obama have to lead you off the stage by your hand?\" question doesn't have a good answer even if delivered semi-cogently.\n\n8.  The moderators will try their best to hurt you and help Biden.  Do their job for them.  Ask him questions.  He's not smart enough to avoid trying to answer them.  \n\nI realize that many of these things go against your nature.  You're mad.  You have a right to be.  But save your anger for after you win.  Look like a President on that stage, because the other guy won't.  ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1dn12gd/free_advice_for_donald_trump_ahead_of_the/"}

The investigation revealed systemic abuse and neglect in these facilities, funded by taxpayer dollars. Here are the key findings and recommendations from the report:\n\n# Key Findings:\n\n1. **Routine Harm to Children**: Children in RTFs suffer from sexual, physical, and emotional abuse, unsafe and unsanitary conditions, and inadequate behavioral health treatment.\n2. **Inherent Risk in the Operating Model**: The operating model of RTFs prioritizes profit over care, leading to minimized therapeutic treatment and deficient environments with underqualified staff.\n3. **Lack of Necessary Treatment**: Despite receiving funds to provide intensive services, RTFs often fail to deliver the required treatment for children with serious behavioral health needs.\n4. **Sexual Abuse**: Persistent, horrific instances of sexual abuse, including staff-on-youth and youth-on-youth abuse, are unremediated in these facilities.\n5. **Misuse of Restraint and Seclusion**: Restraint and seclusion are frequently used inappropriately by unqualified staff, resulting in harm and abuse.\n6. **Understaffing and Poor Training**: RTFs often employ unqualified or inadequately trained staff, leading to supervision failures and child fatalities.\n7. **Non-Homelike and Unsafe Conditions**: Facilities expose children to unsafe, unsanitary conditions, including environmental hazards and communicable diseases.\n8. **Failure to Maintain Community Connections**: RTFs often fail to effectively maintain connections between children and their communities, complicating discharge planning and continuity of care.\n9. **Inadequate Oversight**: State and federal oversight authorities fail to effectively identify and address harm to children in RTFs, often resulting in remedial rather than systemic changes.\n\n[https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/wyden-investigation-exposes-systemic-taxpayer-funded-child-abuse-and-neglect-in-youth-residential-treatment-facilities](https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/wyden-investigation-exposes-systemic-taxpayer-funded-child-abuse-and-neglect-in-youth-residential-treatment-facilities)\n\n  \nI think it's time for some serious reform and defunding of these for-profit facilities.

Trump dodged important questions last night that I wanted to see an answer to. Child care and a plan for social security. As someone with multiple kids in daycare, the costs have rocketed. In the past 5 years, infant care at my daycare has gone from $275 a week in 2019 to over $400 in 2024. \n\nChild care is not affordable at all for the median salaried worker and many families elect to keep a parent home instead to watch the kids. The child care tax credit was a significant benefit to families when it was implemented and should not be thrown away because it came from the other side. If Republicans want to see more families having kids and less abortions, ease the financial barriers of having kids. \n\nSocial Security is a looming problem. The math isn't good and something will have to change if social security is to be continued. Either take a position that it's going to be phased out and replaced by something else or have an answer to how they will keep it funded. Just pointing out that you're going to make the economy better and fix immigration doesn't solve the issue. \n\nHousing has also become out of reach. Come up with a plan to stabilize the market so that people can get there again. Ban foreign investment in real estate. Stop private equity groups from buying all the starter homes up and flipping them for double the price. At the very least acknowledge that it's a huge problem for younger generations. \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1dqinfu/trump_may_have_come_out_on_top_of_the_debate_last/"}

I saw today on a major subreddit the liberals trying to cover this up by spinning it as Joe Biden embracing his wife after the debate while Trump just walked off stage without his wife. That spin won't work. Again, libs rely on snippets of truth instead of truth in context because they know they're full of it.\n\n-- The format CNN used was finally the way that debates should have always been. The questions they asked were mostly pretty good questions. Finally, the moderators got into their heads that the moderators are not running for president, and that they should not be talking or debating with the candidates. The CNN mods asked their questions, enforced time limits, and sometimes repeated their questions. Good.\n\n-- Trump had a few phenomenal lines like \"I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said either\" and \"he's right. He did beat Medicare. He beat it to death.\"\n\n-- Trump and Biden were both pretty well prepared. Biden spouted off some buzzwords and numbers that he had obviously rehearsed. Unfortunately for Biden, he couldn't keep himself together enough to maintain discipline and say his points coherently. Biden struggled to follow the clock and regularly had to be stopped by moderators. Trump always was able to end his point before the clock ran out. Trump was actually pretty clever with how he answered a lot of the questions. There were some questions where no matter what he said, it would make him look bad; Trump was smart enough to talk around the question and use up his time as opposed to directly groveling. Trump had a lot more discipline in this debate than he did in 2020's debates, and I think he looked way better and likable this time.\n\n-- Trump really missed on the most important question of the night in terms of tactics. The most important question was about Israel. This is the question where Trump could convince a huge part of the Democrat voter base to stay home and not vote at all. Instead, Trump used his time to unnecessarily add details to a previous question about Ukraine. Trump didn't take the opportunity to get a slam dunk.\n\n-- Trump's best moments were when he was shitting on Biden. In terms of winning over voters, that's the best angle. Trump was less impressive when he talked about how great his term was. For example, when Joe Biden babbled about how economist experts thought the Biden economy was great, Trump's best answer was saying that families struggling to afford food prove them wrong. But Trump's answer starts to fall flat when he says that economists and advisors of his own said the Trump economy was great. No one gives a fuck about an \"expert\" saying an economy is great. It is a much stronger message to point to the real prices that people see every day.\n\n-- Joe Biden saying that no soldiers died under him is absolutely disgusting. Trump should've blasted him for that line.\n\n-- Did Joe Biden's debate trainers never tell Joe that he should close his mouth while on camera?\n\n-- Joe Biden slipped in and out of being senile and being capable. Some people have hypothesized that he's on a drug \"wake up\" cocktail and that an hour and a half was just too long for that cocktail to work. Sounds about right to me.\n\n-- Truthfully, the lasting impact of the debate will not be the substance of the answers. The lasting impact will solely be that Joe Biden looks like an old fool. I was really doubtful that Trump could win this election, but now I think Trump has the advantage. If there are a couple more debates like this, Trump will solidify his upper hand.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1dqqibt/highlights_of_yesterdays_debate/"}

Focus his attention on the Midwest.  The math is turning more and more in Donald Trump\u2019s favor, but the Democrat\u2019s have one major road to victory that is very plausible: sweep Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.  Trump has taken away almost all the southern states, several of the western swing states, and is getting uncomfortably close in some more traditional Democrat states, but it won\u2019t matter if Joe Biden can win those three states.  All three are city vs. town, urban vs. suburban, makers vs. takers.  Campaign hard where the regular people are.\n\n2. There is one major swing demographic that can give one or the other the victory: white married women.  They are notoriously fickle, vote with their emotions, and their vote can absolutely make the difference.  Donald Trump needs to be going to the affluent suburbs of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Detroit, and Milwaukee, speaking directly to these women.  \u201cI know you didn\u2019t vote for me in 2020, but here is the chance to fix the mess Joe Biden and the Washington establishment.  I will go back to fixing the economy. I will lower gas prices. I will make sure your children will be able to afford college, I will lower home ownership prices.  If you remember what life was like in 2019, I get back to that and make it better.\n\n3. Keep campaigning with Blacks and Hispanics.  Enthusiasm is a real thing and if Donald Trump can find a way to get a 5% gain among blacks and hispanics, he can turn the tide in the above swing states as well.  He needs to go to Hispanic voters and say, \u201cThose of you who are green card carriers and citizens, you are my people and I will fight for you.  I have never threatened you or attempted to deport any legal immigrant.  The people who cross over falsely, those who didn\u2019t do it the right way, like many of you did, those are the people who are hurting us.  By standing by me, there will be more jobs for you.  Your children will have access to far more, and your family will be better off.\u201d  He should go to blacks and say, \u201cAre you better off now or in 2019?  Was your life on the rise then or now? Democrats have promised you many things in the past seventy-five years, and yet many of your family members are living poverty.  In my presidency, I will make sure that the rising tide lifts all boats, and that if you have the desire to work and to raise yourself from poverty, that you will make it.\u201d\n\n4. Focus on domestic issues.  Foreign policy is important, but it is not what the American people care about.  They want to know where the jobs are, whey gas prices are twice as high as they should be, and why their kids aren\u2019t being educated about anything other than woke politics.  Hit those themes, and hit them hard.  I would tell people that every avenue will be opened to get the pipelines moving, that gas taxes will be lowered, that the federal government will get out of the way of job creation and retail prices.  I would focus on letting people know that their real spending power will go up, not down.\n\n5. Be unrelentingly positive.  Pull a page from Ronald Reagan\u2019s book.  Tell people that they have a bright future if they would work with him.  \u201cJoe Biden has already promised to raise taxes, you will feel it in your pocket, and you\u2019ve already experienced it the last for years.  But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way: we will heal the wounds that the last four years opened up.  We will bring back jobs and make sure that you can have a better life, and I will work to ensure that you will have a better life for yourself and your family.  Work with me, vote for me, and in the next four years, we will make America great again.\u201d\n\n**tl;dr**\n\n**Midwest Focus**: Joe Biden needs to win Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania to counter Donald Trump\u2019s gains in the South and West. These states are critical, and the campaign should target rural and suburban voters.\n\n**Target Demographic**: White married women in affluent suburbs are crucial swing voters. Trump should appeal to them by focusing on economic issues, such as lowering gas prices and improving home ownership.\n\n**Minority Outreach**: Trump should seek to increase support among Black and Hispanic voters by highlighting economic improvements during his presidency and promising job growth and opportunities.\n\n**Domestic Issues**: The focus should be on jobs, gas prices, and education rather than foreign policy. Emphasize plans to boost the economy, lower gas taxes, and increase spending power.\n\n**Positive Messaging**: Adopt an optimistic approach, similar to Ronald Reagan, promising a brighter future with job creation and economic growth, contrasting Biden's policies: Joe Biden needs to win Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania to counter Donald Trump\u2019s gains in the South and West. These states are critical, and the campaign should target urban and suburban voters.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1drezf2/the_steps_to_victory_a_strategy_to_victory_for/"}

Only came across a headline mentioning this [garbage paper](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2819785) yesterday.\n\nSince the paper is not open-access, despite JAMA articles of public interest generally being open-access, spent 2 seconds searching the web to find these:\n\n[Fertility Rates by State](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/fertility_rate/fertility_rates.htm), CDC National Center for Health Statistics\n\n\n[Infant Mortality Rates by State](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/infant_mortality_rates/infant_mortality.htm), CDC National Center for Health Statistics\n\nThere were 16,147 more births along with 251 more deaths in Texas in 2022 than in 2021. Not surprisingly, as the CDC figures indicate, the infant mortality rate increased by 0.0424% while the birth rate increased by 0.12% between 2021 and 2022. For the arithmetically-challenged, that means the birth rate increased 3X the infant mortality rate.\n\nAlso worth pointing out to those intentionally oblivious to reality when it comes to pushing pro-abortion propaganda, there is such a thing as natural fluctuation. 251 (or 255) additional infant deaths cannot be statistically associated with the Texas policy reducing the abortion eligibility period from 12 to 6 weeks. There were similar variations year-over-year prior to the change in policy. For example, there were 2,277 and 2,236 infant deaths in 2016 and 2017 in Texas, which happened to correspond to higher number of births, 398,047 and 382,050, respectively. Contrast these with the 368,190 and 373,594 births in 2020 and 2021, the two years preceding the policy change, which also happened to correspond with COVID, and it becomes obvious that this 'research' was nothing more than temporal cherry-picking that any high school dimwit could figure out.\n\nAll of which is to state the obvious: More total number of births necessarily means more total number of deaths, other things being equal. That Texas managed to increase its birth rate at 3X the infant mortality rate speaks to an impressive maternal health care system.\n\nSo, kids, whenever you run into a pro-abortion death cultist who uses such garbage arguments, feel free to enlighten them that the total number of infant deaths is correlated with the total number of infant births, and the only way to reduce the number of infant - and, by extension, maternal - deaths to 0 is not to have any children, which is their actual malevolent, misanthropic objective.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1drjmzn/infant_deaths_after_texas_2021_ban_on_abortion_in/"}

One problem with this is enforcement: people can trade stocks anywhere. Taxing stock trading would drive capital markets overseas.\n\nBut what about just taxing the sale of U.S. treasuries?\n\nDaily trading volume for treasuries is $884.5 billion\u2026 [https://www.sifma.org/resources/research/us-treasury-securities-statistics/](https://www.sifma.org/resources/research/us-treasury-securities-statistics/)\n\nThat would be $323 trillion annually. \n\nA sales tax of 0.3%, if trading volumes were not reduced, would bring in $969 billion per year.\n\n2023, the interest on the debt was $658 billion.\n\nThe tax could slowly pay off the national debt without burdening ordinary Americans. Many of those paying the debt would be foreigners and foreign institutions which speculate on U.S. treasuries.\n\nIf I sell a dollar off a can of soup coupon to someone for a dime, the small words on the coupon claims that the sale voids the entire value of the coupon. Likewise, if anyone or any institution fails to pay the tax, all treasuries that they own could be voided. This is why taxing treasuries alone is superior to trying to tax currency or stocks. Enforcement is actually feasible when taxing treasuries.\n\nFor any treasuries owned by financial firms whose main purpose is to be an ETF for speculating on treasuries, the cost of trading the security could be collected directly from the taxpayers owning the ETF (such as with mutual fund capital gains distributions). For non-taxpayers who trade in ETFs intended for speculating on treasuries, the total cost of the uncollected tax on the ETF can simply be deducted from the treasuries which were owned by the ETF, at the time of their redemption.\n\nThe foreign-held part of the debt is at $8.447 trillion\u2026 [https://www.usdebtclock.org/](https://www.usdebtclock.org/)\n\nIf you could pay off $311 billion of that each year, the foreign-held debt could be eliminated over the next 27 years.\n\nA clause could be included in the bill for the sales tax which would automatically increase the rate of taxation should trading volume decrease, to make up for lost revenue. This would encourage those who are currently engaged in equity trading to keep at it and not stop trading just because of the tax.\n\nNew taxes always have some downsides, but this would have a lot less of an effect on the U.S. economy than  a default. An added bonus is that by the time the 27th year rolls around, China would have a harder time manipulating its currency against the U.S. dollar.

But I have recently learned about the harm that can be caused by fireworks, including through polluting air and water. Below is a list of some of the harm done:\n\n1. Pollution:  Fireworks contain gunpowder and various metals to create the different colours observed. Particles from these fireworks then become airborne causing a health hazard to people as those particles will be inhaled. And those particles will also settle on the ground or water polluting those areas as well.  There is also often plastic debris which may be left on the ground after events.\n2. Injuries:  Around 10,000 emergency room visits and around a dozen deaths caused by fireworks are recorded within the U.S. every year.\n3. Triggering PSTD episodes for veterans:  Many veterans suffer from PTSD and hearing fireworks explosions, seeing the bright flashes, or smelling the smoky air often causes them great discomfort or causes a PTSD episode.\n4. Disturbing others:  Some people will undoubtedly be trying to sleep while others are igniting fireworks. And the fireworks would obviously hinder their sleep. I recently saw a post from a mother who was furious about firework usage while she was trying to let her newborn baby sleep.\n5. Fires:  Fireworks started an estimated 31,000 or so fires in the U.S. in 2022. These fires included structure fires and vehicles fires, but mostly consisted of outside fires or wildfires.\n6. Wildlife disturbance:  Wild animals are often very frightened or disorientated from fireworks. Animals, including the bald eagle, may abandon their nests and try to escape the disturbance. This can lead to the death of their young, and even the adult animals themselves if they crash into buildings or fly too far out to sea.\n7. Pets:  Many pets are also terrified of the disturbance caused by fireworks and will escape the house, yard, or owner. This often ends up with them being hit by vehicles or ending up at an animal shelter. Apparently many animal shelters routinely euthanize animals already under their care to free up space for the influx of animals they expect to receive around the holidays.\n8. Expense:  It is estimated that Americans spent around $2.3 billion on fireworks last year. This is around three times higher than the amount from ten years ago. And based on weight, the use of consumer fireworks is now over four times greater than it was in 2000.\n\nI understand that many people enjoy fireworks, but the use of fireworks is not harmless. And if fireworks are to be used, they should be used in a responsible manner.\n\nI would encourage people to minimize their usage of fireworks or observe public shows already arranged by professionals rather than buying and using their own fireworks, because doing so should help to mitigate some or all of the above listed concerns.\n\nThe following article discusses this topic:\n\n[https://reasonstobecheerful.world/is-it-time-to-break-up-with-fireworks/](https://reasonstobecheerful.world/is-it-time-to-break-up-with-fireworks/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1duxtc6/is_it_time_to_break_up_with_fireworks/"}

Obviously, we keep our foot on the pedal and keep working towards winning,  lbut what realistic option do democrats have to replace Biden? \n\nOption 1: Biden stays the nominee. \n\nHis mental decline will continue to speed up by the time of the general election, and voting him into office is basically national suicide. All of our enemies will go hostile, knowing the us is very weak.\n\nOption 2: Presidential candidate Kamala?\n\nNo one actually thinks Kamala is competent enough of a person to actually run the country. That's why she is bidens VP. Although she had gone up in the betting markets, rn she only sits at 20ish%. \n\nOption 3: The Biden Coup...\n\nI don't realistically see an option where Biden and Kamala both step down, as Jill Biden and Kamala Harris are both pretty power hungry. So, if the delegates at the DNC choose someone else as candidate, then doesn't a huge amount of trust get lost in the DNC? What happens when the current president who is running for reelection who won the primaries gets ousted?  Biden has been in a bad mental state the entire year, and the democrats had all year to have someone run against him. Instead, what do they do? They basically kicked RFK out of their primary... I don't think the American public will vote for someone that they didn't get to vote for in the primaries and one that was only chosen by the elites.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1dycyyz/is_it_possible_for_the_democrats_to_win_the/"}

Because wars cause deficit spending, the Selective Service at the same time serves as a deterrent against deficit spending. Conscription for war and selection for jury both require citizens to render service. For some British subjects in the past, biden days were also required of them.\n\nIn the 19th century, some areas allowed you to work off your property tax bill by improving the roads. More notoriously, African-Americans would be fined for being unemployed and then made to work off their fines. Both of these American practices carried on the tradition of the historical British practice of requiring free labor on biden days to pay the local lord for the privilege of being able to farm his land.\n\nThe 13th and 14th Amendments serve as an obstacle for restoring the practice of biden days, but they are not insurmountable. They do not prevent inmates from being compelled to work. Congress could pass a law criminalizing lobbying for peacetime deficit spending. The victim of this crime are the future generations. The Constitution protects their liberty:\n\n>We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity...\n\nIt follows that debt-servitude is an offense against the liberty of the posterity, and the authority to protect this would fall under the general welfare clause.\n\nCongress members themselves are immune to crimes, so it is not possible to convict them personally for the crime of peacetime deficit spending.\n\nInstead, the crime could be defined as low-level offense similar to a traffic ticket, as follows:\n\nA. **The perpetrators are limited to registered lobbyists**... Has the individual been registered as a lobbyist during the time when deficit spending incurred?\n\nB. **Successful incitement of Congress or the Executive Branch** (to engage in spending)\u2026 Has the lobbyist been documented asking for something that costs money? (This would involve more documentation, either compiled by the lobbyist\u2019s own paperwork or by congressional or executive offices.)\n\nC. **Degree of harm** (Congress engages in deficit spending)... The amount of the fine should equal the amount of the deficit, divided by the number of lobbyists for the year who engaged in Incitement of Congress. In 2023 there were 12,937 registered lobbyists.\n\nIn the event that the three conditions are met, the registered lobbyists would each be given a ticket for the offense of deficit spending. The ticket would require either money or actual labor, defined as a certain number of biden days. Each biden day would be defined as equal to a certain amount of money. The model for this would be the posted signs which say $500 fine or up to 30 days in jail. If you can\u2019t pay the $500, you go to jail to serve your time.\n\nFor the lobbyist, unless they can pay off the actual fine in dollar amounts, they will instead be sentenced to work biden days. All lobbyists who asked for things which cost money would be required to work the same number of biden days, unless they can pay the fine in dollars.\n\nThe lobbyists would have to work off the ticket by being assigned to fill the labor needs which would otherwise be filled by illegal immigrants. Businesses could voluntarily apply to receive biden day labor. The lobbyists could keep a percentage of their pay, but the rest would be sent as remittances to the U.S. government to help reduce the deficit. It would only be a symbolic amount in the whole scheme of the federal deficit, but it would ensure that they at least feel some of the pain the future generations must bear.\n\nJust like with traffic tickets, lobbyists would accrue points on their record. The points for each lobbyist would expire over every Congressional or election cycle, but would need to be publicly reported for each organization they represent, as part of the existing documentation.\n\nYes, it really is called biden days.

This tenure did not strictly entitle them to be called free tenants; the verdict of a jury in 1203-5, in the case of Prior Geoffry, of Canterbury, as to the land of a tenant, was *non est francum tenementum, sed ad furcam et flagellum ad falcandum et metendum* Add MSS. 6037, c. 1810\n\nGoogle renders the Latin as *it is not a freehold, but a fork and a whip for mowing and reaping*.\n\nAnother\u2026 [https://books.google.com/books?id=KfgUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA716](https://books.google.com/books?id=KfgUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA716)\n\n>PRECARLAE, or PRECES (Law Lat.)

Vulgarly called \u201cbind days,\u201d which Spelman supposes to be a corruption of \u201cbiden days,\u201d which in Saxon, answered to *dies precariae* (literally, pray days, or prayed days), the Saxon *biden* signifying to pray.

Vast quantities of land in the northern counties, particularly in Cumberland, are held under lords of manors by *customary* tenure subject to the payment of fines and heriots, and the performance of various duties and services on the *boon* days. Spelman, vo. precari\u00e6, refers to \u201cBIDEN DAYS,\u201d quod Sax. \u201c*Dies precarias* sonat, nam *bidden* est orare et precari;\u201d and gives a curious extract from the Great Book of the Monastery of Battel, where the custom is plainly set forth.\n\nGoogle renders the Latin as *it sounds precarious, for we must pray and be prayed for .*\n\nThe meaning of \u201cBiden\u201d was apparently known well enough in the 1800s for \u201cLord Biden\u201d to be a character in a legal joke. The name itself was part of the joke, because just like how things operated with *biden* days in feudalism, those serving on juries are conscripted \u2026 [https://books.google.com/books?id=qdcBAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA92&dq=%22Lord+Biden%22](https://books.google.com/books?id=qdcBAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA92&dq=%22Lord+Biden%22)\n\n>\u201cI REMEMBER,\u201d says Lord Biden, \u201cMr. Justice Gould trying a case at York, and when he had proceeded for about two hours, he observed, \u2018Here are only eleven jurymen in the box, where is the twelfth?\u2019 \u2018Please you, my lord,\u2019 said one of the eleven, \u2018he has gone away about some other business\u2014*but he has left his verdict with me!*\u2019 \u201c\n\nClearly \u201cLord Biden\u201d wasn\u2019t the sharpest magistrate out there.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1e19d96/restoring_the_historic_british_practice_of_biden/"}

Based on these reports, popular visited subreddits are now claiming he was a \"Trumper trying to martyr \\[Donald Trump\\]\" and are shifting the narrative against Republicans.  In anticipation of the media running off with these narratives, here are facts for you to be aware about.\n\n* The shooter's name was Thomas Matthew Crooks, a\u00a0[20-year-old](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/14/us/trump-shooting-thomas-matthew-crooks-intl-hnk/index.html)\u00a0from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. The shooter was born in\u00a0[September 2003](https://www.mediaite.com/trump/trump-shooter-was-a-registered-republican/). [DW reports](https://www.dailywire.com/news/police-ransack-home-of-20-year-old-suspected-shooter-who-donated-to-liberal-org-on-bidens-inauguration-day?topStoryPosition=2) that his mother is a registered Democrat and his father is a registered Libertarian.\u00a0\n* The [shooter wore a Demolition Ranch shirt](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-shooter-reportedly-wearing-demolition-ranch-merchandise-t-shirt-1924914). Demolition Ranch is an apolitical firearms-content Youtube channel.  Despite what many are claiming, it is not alt-right content.\n* He was a registered Republican. A report suggests he [registered in September 2021](https://www.1lurer.am/en/2024/07/14/Identity-of-the-person-who-shot-Trump-known/1157100) upon turning 18.  He has not voted for Trump as [this year\u2019s presidential election would have been the first he was old enough to vote in.](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/07/14/us/trump-shooting-thomas-matthew-crooks-intl-hnk)\n* The records \"show that his one known political donation, for $15 in 2021, was to Act Blue, a group that supports Democratic candidates.\"\u00a0[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/13/donald-trump-shot-live-updates.html),\u00a0[StarAdvertiser](https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/07/13/breaking-news/heres-what-is-known-about-the-suspected-gunman/). Through Act Blue, he specifically donated to the Progressive Turnout Project.\u00a0[Some reported](https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/what-we-know-about-the-suspected-trump-rally-shooter/)\u00a0that this donation was made the day Biden was sworn into office in January 2021.\n* \"The motive is still not clear\" via an expressed manifesto. But what is clear is that he tried to permanently silence a Presidential candidate. An attempt to assassinate a Presidential candidate is an act clearly politically motivated against Trump and Republicans. (Some people need this spelled out to them.)\n\nBased on these facts, it's inconclusive to determine Crooks, a progressive donor, was a Republican-gone-rogue just because he registered as Republican ([Reddit democrats admit this is a tactic](https://imgur.com/a/tSN74CR)\u00a0to affect primaries; this is known as [cross-voting covered here](https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-crossover-voting-gop-primary-republicans-trump-1850387)).  Regardless he's definitely\u00a0**anti-Trump**.  That's the only point that actually matters.

For the moment, President Trump is in the rare position of holding the moral high ground, by virtue of his near-assassination. Remember the old saying, \"Never let a crisis go to waste\"? I know it sounds flippant, but it is what it is.\n\nEvery forum I've visited has pages and pages of the worst Democratic and progressive vitriol on display. Wishes that the gunman's aim had been better, etc. Stomach-turning hatefulness. Perusing these messages, I wanted to respond in kind, but I paused. *We have been given an opportunity to show that we're better than that.\"\n\nMaybe it's time to take a page from Jesus' playbook. Jesus told us to love our enemies and pray for the ones who persecute us. Paul expounded further on this idea, writing (emphasis mine), \"Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God\u2019s wrath. ...If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head. *Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.*\"\n\nI realize not everyone here is a Christian, but I think this advice is solid regardless of your path. Imagine the impact we could make right now if we set out to *overcome evil with good*! If our reaction was not more hateful vitriol (even if such is warranted) but ... charity? Patience? Kindness, faith, hope? Do we not have an opportunity here to change hearts and minds, to change the tone of the discourse, if we can manage to rise to the occasion, instead of simply grinding our axes?\n\nYeah I know it's hard. It's hard to hold one's tongue and avoid replying in anger, especially online where you're anonymous and won't be held to account for your words. I know this as much as anyone; I've probably said some really nasty things over the years, out of frustration and disdain. But maybe I can be better than that. I'm going to give it a shot.\n\nAnd I hope when he addresses the convention in a couple of days, President Trump can rise above it too, and deliver a message of positivity, envisioning a bright future for this country. Perhaps this terrible incident can be a turning point, a rock bottom from which we ascend. I really hope so. I'm going to try to do my part.

They have spread so much hatred, so far and so deep among their cult, they don't even view their opposition as humans anymore.  This speech was meant to dissuade some of this, but was hollow and, in it's omissions, doubles down on the hatred.  \n  \nThis is all coming from someone who can't stand Trump and often votes third party (libertarian), including last year.

The main argument I'm seeing is: \"Biden called Trump 'the greatest threat to our nation' several times\" vs \"Trump called Biden a threat to Democracy too\"\n\nIn my mind, this obfuscates the true problem and twists us Conservatives into making an anti-free speech argument. Let me be clear: ALL politicians use hyperbolic language and talk about metaphorically 'fighting' against something or stopping the other guy because they're 'the biggest threat' to something.\n\nHere's the thing though: The speech of AN INDIVIDUAL doesn't matter! A politician can't be held responsible for a nut who would take that as a call to physically fight. (Don't get me wrong, during the Floyd Riots there were definitely politicians endorsing the violence, all while pretending they cared about WuFlu distancing, but that distracts from the main point and is different from this one lone nut)\n\nTHE CORE POINT: I'm no Constitution expert, but free speech applies to an individual. Trump calling the system corrupt is protected speech, as is Trump or Biden hurling insults at each other. However, the System/Establishment/Deep State/Whatever does not have the same protection. The System, with every pawn politician, agency, media network under their control, acting as separate entities but all on the same email chain, receiving the same instructions, parroting the same talking points, and ignoring the same realities in a coordinated 8+ year effort to villainize one man, is an actual problem. That's the very definition of propaganda and it's definitely responsible for radicalizing room temp IQs and the ignorant youth.\n\nI mean, the twerp was 20, right? So he's been exposed to this propaganda almost half his life and during his formative years. Don't get me wrong, I believe in individual autonomy (He was at fault for his actions), but I don't discount the attempt by the System to mold such a useful idiot.\n\nTo conclude, I don't think it's wrong to show the posts of prominent people calling Trump Hitler, but it needs to be in the context of the bigger picture: THE SYSTEM is calling Trump Hitler, a dictator, etc. because they know that some fools will believe it and almost all of us would kill Hitler or Hitler 2.0. It's not even bad; It's your civic duty. It would be wrong not to kill a dictator. That's their angle. That's the main point I don't see being discussed.\n\nLet me know what you think or what I'm missing.\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1e419du/i_think_people_are_missing_the_biggest_takeaway/"}

That is if you have the basic education enough to read a ballot, anyway. I understand the majority of you racist rednecks can't even read this post, though. But those who can, please pass my message on to the rest of your inbred family.\n\nWe Democrats are morally, culturally and intellectually superior to you in every way. I will qualify myself by noting that I have a Liberal Arts degree from a college, which you obviously have never been to, if you even know what one is. I also have a black friend. I have been told by several professors that everything you hold dear is terrible. Therefore you, personally, are also terrible.\n\nI don't know you, but I know that you're racist. I also know that you hate gay people and still get scared during lightning storms.\n\nThe religion which you hold closely, greatly believe in, and which brings you comfort--you are wrong because I'm smarter than you and I'm telling you so. It is one of the many reasons why you are stupid and I'm better than you.\n\nYou see, us Democrats want a system which helps everyone in the world. Our system is designed around love and kindness to everyone. If you don't agree, I hate you.\n\nIt's not too late to change. If you knew your history, which of course you don't, you'll remember a time in America when Indians were dragged away from their homes and forced to assimilate into white society. Well, we want to change that kind of behaviour (sorry for my spelling, as I'm not from your country) by making sure you go to college and have a small apartment in a big, busy coastal city, where you belong. That will help you rid yourselves of your backward, incorrect culture and way of thinking. We'll do everything we can to make sure you agree with us and say all the right things and not be brainwashed against thinking the same way we do.\n\nAll of you stupid, backward, redneck, racist, homophobic, uneducated yokels need to realize we're trying to build a classless society where we all get to live in harmony with each other, where we're all equal. If you only understood that you wouldn't be so much worse of a person than I am.\n\nSo please vote Democrat.

The reason was I wanted to understand their concerns about this Heritage document.  I'd like to discuss my impression of their concerns and I'm very interested in any feedback or correction that yall feel inclined to provide.  My takeaway is that they seem to believe that Project 2025 will make America a fascist nation.  To me that's an absurd and shocking claim.  In my mind a fascist nation is, among other things, at least actively engaged in some kind of genocide on millions of their own countrymen and that's self evidently not us.   I realize there's nuance and how people define fascism varies but I think my litmus test is a solid one for the average concerned voter.\n\nThe meat and potatoes of Project 2025 seems to me to center around the president's executive oversight of federal employees.  Please correct me if I've misunderstood that.  Essentially the Heritage foundation wants to change policy so that the President can fire deep state operatives at will and place other people in charge who would obey policy.\n\nI don't honestly disagree with that and I don't think it's a big deal.  If your beliefs are such that you cannot follow company policy then you should remove yourself and find a new job.  It makes sense that an employer, even the government, would have an interest in their staff obeying lawful orders.  I don't think that's fascist.  If you're being ordered to commit genocide well that would be a fascist order but if you're being ordered to loosen restrictions on the water pressure that's allowed for shower heads I think that's something that falls into the category of things reasonable people can disagree on.  Even if you have strong beliefs on climate change that compel you to desire weak shower heads you're just going to have to eat it on that one or run for president yourself.\n\nSome of their other concerns are things like using the FDA to remove the approval of abortion pills.  I fail to see how that is fascist, even a full pro-life position isn't fascist at all.  The soldiers who stormed the beaches of Normandy to overthrow fascism all hailed from the USA which had a complete abortion ban at every stage in place at the time.  Conservatives using federal authority to ban an abortion pill is merely conservatives doing conservative things.  It's almost like elections have consequences or something, if you want universal access in all 50 states forever you need to pass an amendment that's how this works.\n\nAnother thing I see them concerned about is that the project discusses restrictions on pornography.  I actually  don't think pornography should be legal, but I'm okay standing alone on that one.  That said, there's no reason it needs to be super easy to get to.  Requiring people to upload an ID or something makes sense and would help keep it away from children.  The left doesn't seem to think that requiring an ID to purchase firearms is fascist and that's our second amendment, why would it be fascist to require an ID for pornography?\n\nAnd then after that it trails off into the bizarre.  They are worried that if Trump wins this will be our last election and we will become Gilead, they think that LGBTQ people will be rounded up into concentration camps, and other nonsense things like that.  It's a lot of fear porn basically but it gets some people riled up.  We have that kinda stuff, just differently, on our side too so maybe I shouldn't judge too hard.\n\nWhen you remove the windmill tilting and wacky interpretations Project 2025 just reads to me like a policy recommendation that Trump may or may not choose to use parts of.  Some of it sounds like I'm being threatened with a good time to be quite honest.  So that's my takeaway I'm open to yours.

Tons to misinformation over the Trump campaign floods the internet and as an undecided voter I spend a ton of time reading about the different candidates. One of the biggest things I\u2019ve noticed are discrepancies in how Trump\u2019s platform reported. \n\n\nThe first thing I want to address is that **Agenda 47** is real. \n\nIt\u2019s his offices platform found on his official website. It\u2019s even called \u201cAgenda 47\u201d in the URL. I\u2019ve seen people here claim Agenda 47 is another left wing invention, but it\u2019s not. Please read about it on his website at the links below. \n\nhttps://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47\n\nSo let\u2019s be clear, Agenda 47 is Donald Trump\u2019s platform. It\u2019s in his website. It\u2019s literally his platform on his website. \n\nIt\u2019s clear as day. \n\nThere\u2019s even a link to a 16 page easy to digest platform pdf file \n\nhttps://rncplatform.donaldjtrump.com/?_gl=1*1uq5y6o*_gcl_au*ODc3MTYzMTc1LjE3MjA5MzUyODM.&_ga=2.247167361.483972484.1721665174-93371808.1720935284\n\nThis is his official platform. End of story.\n\n*****\n\nWhat is **Project 2025?**\n\nWell, it is *not* Trump\u2019s platform. Project 2025 is a proposed policy platform created by the Heritage Foundation, a very conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C.  They have created policy platforms for all presidential candidates in the past in hopes of pushing conservative Christian-centric policies into the presidential platform.  They are not new. They are not representative of the president. They are essentially a lobbying group that focuses on influencing presidential and down trace policy. \n\nSo, to clarify, Project 2025 is not Trump platform. It wouldn\u2019t shock me if there was some crossover, that\u2019s bound to happen. But the nearly 1,000 page Project 2025 proposal is not Trump\u2019s agenda. It\u2019s an independent policy \u201cwish list\u201d from an independent think tank that push very conservative Christian values in hopes of influencing national policies.\n\n*****\n\nFurthermore, a common claim I\u2019ve seen is that Agenda 47 is just the Trump campaign name for Project 2025. \n\nThis is categorically false. \n\nYou can read both of them online. I\u2019m not going to link to the Project 2025 stuff but you can easily find it yourself if you\u2019re curious. \n\n**Agenda 47 is vastly different from Project 2025.** Project 2025 is much more conservative, traditionally conservative, than anything Trump is putting out. Dare I say, Trump has much more of a libertarian-leaning states\u2019 rights focus on his agenda than anything you can find within Project 2025, which is essentially the wet dream of Dick Cheney. \n\nSo, I just wanted to put that out there. I hope this helps at least some people understand what these two things are. \n\n ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1e9iqt9/agenda_47_vs_project_2025_clearing_the_air/"}

Before she has a chance to answer, Charlamagne Tha God interrupts by asking what music Harris listened to while smoking marijuana in college.\u00a0\u00a0Harris laughs\u00a0but\u00a0ignores\u00a0Charlamagne\u00a0Tha\u00a0God\u2019s\u00a0question\u00a0and\u00a0responds to the original\u00a0query\u00a0of what music she listens to\u00a0by saying \u201cSnoop Dogg\u201d, \u201cTupac\u201d and adds that she loves \u201cCardi B\u201d.\n\nReuters says explicitly \"Harris laughs but ignores Chalamagne the God\". However, you can clearly hear that the co-host is adding on to Charlamagne's questions by saying \"**was it** Snoop?\", after Charlamagne asked his question. Key words is **was.** He continued in past tense, taking key from the host. He did not say **is it** Snoop (and for those reasons, Reuters, I'm out).\n\nShe was CLEARLY not answering the original question of \"what kind of music does Kamala Harris listen to\" since it was cut off in the middle by the star and creator of the show, Charlamange, asking what she listened to when \"you was high\"...\n\nAnyone that acts like going on a radio show, and ignore the question from the host, is just trying to mislead you. That is not how radio shows, work. You ignore the host, and it goes straight to commercials, and you are not coming back on.\n\nShe was obviously lying to try to fit herself into the crowd she was with. If she is lying in that kind of low stakes environment, do people really think she doesn't have the capacity to lie in a high stakes environment? Just look at her history as a prosecuter.\n\n[Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/fact-checkkamala-harris-did-not-say-she-listened-to-snoop-dogg-and-tupac-while-idUSKBN25G1ID/)\n\ntime stamped link to relevant part of the [interview](https://youtu.be/Kh_wQUjeaTk?t=2287)\n\nTranscribed:\n\nco-host: \"what do you listen to boo (looks at Charlamagne) \"since I know she has to go, so\" (back looking at Kamala) \"What does Kamala Harris listen t\" (Cut off by Charlamange)\n\nCharlamange: What were you listenen to when you was high? what was on? (Kamala laughs as he asks the question) (Charlamange takes a drink of water as she is laughing)\n\nCo-host: **was it** Snoop?\n\nKamala: OH MY GOODNESS! Oh yeah, definitely Snoop. UHUH. 2-Pac (Looks directly at the co-host that asked the question), for sure, for sure.\n\nCo-host: What's your favorite hiphop artist NOW?\n\nKamala: You know who I REALLY love, is Cardi B.\n\nPOINT BEING FOLKS, don't let the leftie media \"do the research\". Since they can say whatever their opinion is in the article, and link to the accurate information, but they are assuming that you wont click the links.\n\nSorry for the rant, but I feel like there hasn't been enough ACTUAL reasons why Kamala will lose posted here, other that \"we no like\". There are reasons we no like... please talk about them, and spread them, or else the left is going to talk about \"oh you don't like her since you are racist and sexist\".\n\nNext up: Kamala was deemed the border czar... and \\_only\\_ let 10M people through... what a great job she did", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1e9vlto/watch_out_we_are_about_to_be_and_already_are/"}

Biden was also very intent on telling everyone that he was not dropping out and that he would continue the race. Then, overnight, everyone who used to support him turned on him, and his resignation was posted in a tweet.\n\nNot to mention, it was also reported that Biden got COVID, and his last public appearance was five days ago, where he looked very frail and weak and had to be physically supported by other people. The signature on his resignation letter also looks photoshopped. There was no presidential seal, and I think it's pretty obvious that it's not actually Biden on his Twitter account.\n\nHis supposed \"phone call\" to Kamala Harris is also very suspicious ([https://x.com/RNCResearch/status/1815507067303522367?t=3Cd7GA99T7poQ\\_Aivls1vA&s=19](https://x.com/RNCResearch/status/1815507067303522367?t=3Cd7GA99T7poQ_Aivls1vA&s=19)).\n\nKamala trips over her words and almost says \"recording\" instead of call. Biden also just sounds very weird throughout this supposed \"call,\" and I wouldn't be surprised if it was some kind of AI voice. I really don't see why they couldn't have a video feed of him somewhere to show that it's actually him speaking.\n\nOf course, there could be a simpler explanation, and the Democrats simply saw him as a liability and wanted him out, but I can't get this weird feeling out of me that he's dead. I think the biggest problem with my theory is that keeping this secret hidden for long would be very hard.

Let me dissect a few narratives that has started coming from the left.\n\nFirst one is the magical \"VP Pick\" - it's probably Cooper from NC or M. Kelly from AZ. Combining Kamala Harris with a \"normal White Man\" didn't work out this year for Biden/Harris but now if we put Harris on the top of a ticket with a \"normal White Man,\" we will most definitely flip those -11 likely voter polls.\n\nSecond one, she's the prosecutor who will prosecute the \"case\" against Trump. Love the coping from shitlibs who think Kamala's record as a Senator and VP will magically vanish and people will supposedly start paying attention to her days as AG.  \nShe is pro crime, pro BLM, pro Antifa, pro looting, pro rioting, pro burning down buildings, etc in fact she was bailing out these rioters back in 2020.\n\nThere's one side of me who thinks - Yes, until that banner hits 270, we should NOT get complacent and win no matter who it is.\n\nThere's another side of me who thinks - Pelosi/Obama/Schumer have pretty much seen the writing on the wall. For them Kamala, is the fall guy. Biden gets to save his legacy by being the guy who saw the writing on the wall and couldn't continue out of his selflessness, Kamala could help dems save their downballot bleeding, I think they know the Presidency is unattainable. \n\nBottom line - Kamala is NOT remotely as strong as Biden - no matter how much you spend on her", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1ea7qrh/i_know_we_should_not_get_complacent_about_kamala/"}

I worked for the Gary Johnson campaign and was good friends with a staffer that worked for Clinton\u2019s campaign and he introduced it to me because he was tasked with finding out how Johnson\u2019s polling was jacking up their formulas. He was one of the only democrats I knew that thought Hillary was going to lose going into election night. \n\nAnyways, seeing as we\u2019re hitting prime \u201cpolling\u201d season, I want to make sure I share it with all of you. \n\n*****\n\nTL;DR: You need to give the Republican Candidate a ~4% buffer in national polling to account for how densely located democrat voters are. \n\n*****\n\nLonger version: \n\nThe fact that democratic voters are largely centralized around population centers means that many of their votes are \u201cwasted\u201d.\n\nFor an example of what I mean: \n\nIn 2016 Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 2.8 million. \n\nShe won California by 4.3 million. \n\nShe won New York by 1.7 million. \n\nShe won Illinois by 1 million.\n\nTrump, however, won the election. \n\nHow? \n\nHe won the electoral college. \n\nHow? \n\nHe won Michigan by 10k votes.  He won Wisconsin by 22k votes. He won PA by 44k votes.\n\nThose millions upon millions of \u201cextra\u201d votes Clinton won in CA, NY, and IL did nothing to help her win the national election.\n\nCampaign strategists are aware of this and give an average of a 4% buffer to the RNC candidate.\n\nSo basically, a democrat candidate for president needs to lead national polls by at least 4% to be comfortable in their chances to win the election.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s final polling in 2016 showed her up by an aggregate of 3.6%. She won the popular vote by 2.8 million votes but lost the electoral college 227 to 304. \n\nFor another example. The final aggregate poll for Al Gore in 2000 had him up 1.3%. Gore won the popular vote by 543k votes but lost the electoral college. 266-271. \n\nBoth democrats were up by less than 4% in final aggregate polling and both lost the election. \n\n\u201cPaddy! You\u2019re just cherry picking! This is such a cope!\u201d\n\nIs it? \nWhat about other elections? \n\nWell, let\u2019s look:\n\nJoe Biden in 2020. The final aggregate poll? 5.1%. Biden won. \n\nObama in 2012? 4.2%. Obama won. \n\nObama in 2008? 5.7%. Obama won. \n\nBush in 2004? Final polling showed a draw. Dead even at 49%. (Not so fun fact: This is the only election since 1988 that the GOP candidate won the popular vote)\n\nClinton had 10%+ leads in aggregate polling in both 1996 and 1992 and won both elections easily. \n\nState politics have changed a lot since the 80s and the numbers get too muddled to be reliable, especially with how lopsided the Reagan elections were. \n\n***** \n\nSo, right now, the most up to date polls have Trump up 1.8% over Harris and had him up 3% over Biden.\n\nIn reality, this means Trump has about a 5.8% lead over Harris.\n\nFor Harris to win, she needs to overcome this 5.8% deficit.\n\nIt would be an absolutely shocking comeback, but obviously not impossible. The only reason Bush won in 2000 was because he secured Florida. \n\nSo yea, none of this is to tell anyone to \u201crelax, this is in the bag\u201d, but considering I\u2019ve already received 4 spam texts today alone about how Harris is \u201cleading in the polls\u201d (one poll, Reuters by 2%) I wanted to share this with everyone. I shared it recently in another sub and it was well received and I figured if anyone else would want to know this that might not, it\u2019s people here. \n\nAlso, to clarify, this is only for national head to head polling. Not state polling or \u201c3 way matchup\u201d or other variants. Only for national head to head polling. \n\nPlus, if you *really* want to track how the election is going, you\u2019ll pay attention to state polls instead of random one-off national polls.

The more I educated myself the more I questioned why I even believed the things I did.\n\nI know that as a California resident my vote doesn\u2019t matter, but I think I\u2019m going to vote Trump this fall. This is coming from someone who ALWAYS voted Dem straight down the line. Who cried tears when Trump won in 2016. I still have some complaints about the guy, he\u2019s far from perfect, but I\u2019m realizing that he far, far, FAR better represents my best interests as an American compared to ANYONE in the major Democratic establishment. And that I was painted a very incomplete picture of him by mainstream media.\n\nBtw I\u2019m a young Indian American woman and Kamala ain\u2019t fooling me. \n\nAnyone else here converted from left to right? What was your journey like? I\u2019m still very much in the \u201ccloset\u201d so I don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to about this. \n\nEDIT! Since so many people are asking which issues I changed my mind on. Posting some here:\n\n- Gender ideology. I have some trans friends and started very left on this issue. The more I studied it and learned about it, the less I believed in it and the more I felt it encroached on women\u2019s rights. The entire ideology actually makes NO sense when you think about it and the assault on children is unforgivable to me. \n\n- Immigration. I grew up in the 90s and I remember an era where \u201cillegal\u201d immigrants were mostly hard working, contributing members of society. That has changed. The migrant crisis is out of control and these immigrants are no longer your hard working laborers who love America, they are leeching off the system and worsening the quality of life of hardworking Americans. AND turning around and lambasting the country that has given them such a great life \n\n- Government size. I used to have this very idealistic view that government was an instrument of good and that the real world White House looked like the TV show The West Wing. I used to support big government because I thought it would help the misfortunate. Now I realize that in our world, bigger government = more corruption \n\n- being \u201csoft on crime\u201d. Again, I don\u2019t think the justice system is black and white and I do think it has some flaws but I used to believe that being soft on crime was the compassionate thing to do. That most criminals weren\u2019t actually criminals, just unfairly targeted and victimized by the justice system. But I\u2019ve spent most of my adult life between San Francisco and LA and I\u2019ve realize that we cannot live in a society that doesn\u2019t punish crime. And honestly at this point Democrat policies almost incentives crime, which is so difficult to look past \n\n- Guns. I still support some measures of gun control but I used to support fully repealing the 2nd amendment. I don\u2019t anymore. I\u2019ve lived in the real world now and I understand the need to have a gun (especially as a single woman). I\u2019ve gotten more involved in gun culture and the people have been welcoming and warm and I\u2019ve come to view them in a new light \n\n-  Taxes. I used to think it was moral to pay taxes through the nose but I\u2019m looking around and wondering\u2014where the hell is all my money going?! Education, infrastructure, housing, etc. have all been continuously going downhill. So why is half my paycheck going into taxes? How is it benefitting me and other Americans?!\n\n- DEI/racism/affirmative action. This is a huge one for me. As an Indian American, affirmative action very much discriminated against me but I was naive enough to think \u201cwell that\u2019s a good thing! That\u2019s how things should be! I should have to work harder for the same thing than other races.\u201d Very warped brain state. I\u2019m very well aware that my status as a female \u201cperson of color\u201d and as someone who legitimately has some real life claims to \u201cvictimhood\u201d could have very much aided me in my career and life in recent years. But I realized I do NOT want that to be a defining factor of my personhood. I don\u2019t want it to be that for anyone\u2019s. We should all be judged for our MERIT. The fact that Kamala was a DEI pick and stands to become the next president without truly earning the position? Embarrassing. We should treat people with compassion and be understanding of individual circumstances but I reject DEI in its entirely and always will. I reject the leftists victomhood narrative wholeheartedly.\n\nEDIT #2: thank to those of you who have been supportive and engaging with your comments! I will try to get around to responding to everyone but the majority of you have been great and I\u2019ve really enjoyed reading the feedback and discussion. Some of y\u2019all have been a tad unhinged but I guess that\u2019s expected from the internet lol. No I\u2019m not a bot and no I\u2019m not a fake.

I hope to maybe hear some words of encouragement from my fellow Conservatives here.\n\nI'm 35(m). I grew up in a mostly conservative household with certain liberal values. Neither of my parents had college degrees but I watched them build a very successful business from scratch. I learned to appreciate and see what working for yourself can be from my parents. That is one of the most important lessons they taught me. My parents always voted republican after Clinton. 2008, the year I graduated and the first election I was able to vote in, I voted for Obama. My parents and I had discussions and respectful disagreements at the dinner table over this, explaining their perspective as business owners. And mine as an 18 year old kid enamored at the thought of change. After the 2008 election I never voted again until 2020. From 2008-2020 I largely ignored politics. When I noticed nothing in my life changed at 18 right after voting for Obama I almost had this apathetic trust in our system that no matter who was in office my life would remain unchanged. Everything I wanted in life was available to me so long as I worked hard enough(and SMART enough) to achieve it. Never would I think the government would actually hinder or help my ability with this.\n\nI didn't go to college but I did go to a trade school. I was fortunate as a young teenager to find a passion in working on cars. So when I graduated high school it was a no brainer for me as to what I should do. Two years out of high school and I was already making $60k a year as a mechanic. While all my high school friends were still living off their parents and going to college, I was getting a head start. I excelled in this industry and over the course of 10 years I went from being a mechanic to owning and operating my own shop. We are now one of the highest rated shops in my area, with just one location we are projected to gross close to 2.5 million this year. But I am by no means rich. The margins in this industry are thin and the overhead is wide. Having been a mechanic for many years I also take very good care of my loyal and hardworking employees. My lowest paid employee makes close to 70k a year and is only 23 years old. I have three other employees that make just over $115k a year. Which is more than I pay myself. But owning a business has made me feel like I have more control over my destiny. A stark contrast to my liberal friends who work for giant corporations whom are always seeking government intervention to make their lives easier.\n\nTrumps first term was the first time I noticed a president to have any effect on my life. Our business is incorporated and the Trump corporate tax breaks straight up allowed me to hire an additional employee. This was the catalyst that boomed our business. By 2020 we were killing it. I could see the American Dream clearly. And side note, covid actually helped our business since new cars were hard to come by and used car prices sky rocketed. This meant it was more cost effective for consumers to fix the cars they had rather than trade them in. I saw this as temporary and did my best to not make any drastic decisions around the sudden increase in business. However I did have to hire another employee to keep up. Although we haven't seen as much growth as the recent previous year, we're in pretty good shape. But even all my other shop owner friends would agree, this year seems different. Its been much more difficult to even maintain pre-pandemic numbers. Its obvious consumers are worried about spending money. If this continues and certain small business benefits go away, I fear for more difficult years ahead. I do have faith that we will always figure out a way to keep our current staff. I appreciate my employees so letting someone go will always be the last decision I make after trying everything else. I would further decrease my own pay before letting that happen.\n\nI got engaged this year. Our wedding is planned for August 2025. My Fianc\u00e9 and I have been really excited to really kick start our \"American Dream\". We want to buy a house. I'm kicking myself for not buying a house in the pre-pandemic market but I always eventually wanted to start a family and was just so focused on the business I figured I would just wait until I met someone special enough to get me to tie the knot. But with the direction the media is forcing the wind to blow with Harris, I am very very worried a Kamala presidency would push our dreams further back. Or negate them all together. I am concerned about the challenges I might face as a parent in a post Kamala America. Let alone small business owner. Suddenly I am now my Dad and nervously watching the news. Except for me it appears I have a much bigger set of problems to deal with than my parents did.

Let's Start Here", "body": "There is a narrative of fear-mongering circulating in social media right now about all of the terrible things that will happen if Trump is reelected. The claims that \"you won't have to vote\" in four years because Trump will have installed himself as dictator. The fears about \"Project 2025\" ... etc. How do we combat this? How do we persuade voters that the vast, vast majority of Republicans only want good things for our country? \n\nLet's start here. I and all of the conservatives I know want:\n\nA constitutional Republic with free and fair elections. No one wants a dictator; that's just silly. \n\nPeace in the world; American leadership resulting in the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine being resolved, hostages returned, the killing (especially of children) to stop.  \n\nNational security which includes strong borders; we can't have people coming in willy-nilly and being given hearing dates years into the future. It is wrong to allow people to establish lives and families here only to deport them. This practice has to end. It's inhumane.\n\nA decent education for all children. No, we don't seek to destroy public schools in order to make a buck off privatizing them; we just want all children to be educated. Right now, too many public schools are failing to do so, and there are no easy ways to turn them around; in fact, with contractual obligations and tenure, there is almost no way to eliminate under-performing staff and replace them. In some cases, the only viable solution has been to start from scratch with an entirely new cast of characters. But if you have a better idea, we'd love to hear it! \n\nMost conservatives do not care who you choose to sleep with as long as it's a consenting adult and you do so in private. \n\nI don't know anyone who wants to \"oppress women\" by denying them abortions; we simply view unborn children as CHILDREN and want to protect them, in the same way that you would probably jump to the rescue of a four-year-old about to be hit by a speeding car. That's our entire motivation, wanting to save human lives. There is nothing sinister about it. All of us are deeply troubled about the idea that some conceptions occur as a result of rape or incest and most are willing to grant exceptions under those terrible circumstances out of compassion for the victim.\n\nEvery conservative I know believes that we ought to help the poor, elderly, children, disabled, etc. Many of us are OK with government social welfare programs, while some of us think that assistance should come from private charity. But no one wants to see helpless people suffer and die. \n\nI don't know a single conservative who cares whether you are white, black, brown, green or purple. Regardless of race or national origin, you are welcome in our tent. We object to preferential treatment being given on the basis of race. Let all be judged on their merits and the content of their character. \n\nLikewise, I don't know a single conservative who cares whether you identify as male, female, neither or something in between. As long as you are a productive citizen and good neighbor, who cares? Do your own thing. Live and let live. \n\nFinally, the biggest difference between us (conservatives) and you (progressives) is our belief in the role of government. You tend to think that the only way we can have nice things is if the government provides them, either by legislating them or subsidizing them. We disagree. Take something like childcare: you think the government should pay for it or subsidize it. We think families should be able to earn enough, and allowed to keep enough of their earnings through low taxes, to make the decision that is best for them, either to put their child in daycare or for a parent to stay home and take care of them. Rather than raising taxes and redistributing money, we think the solution to nearly all problems is to leave the money in the pockets of the people who earned it and let them figure out what works best for them.\n\nIN CLOSING ... if you agree with me on the above points, please chime in here to let the progressive know that we're not really the strawmen that are being built by the Left. We are not hateful; we are not stupid; we just want our country to be strong, secure, free and prosperous, and if you believe the same, you are welcome to join us. Thank you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1edg65k/how_do_we_get_the_word_out_lets_start_here/"}

Without this written down and shared, objectively she is a completely hollow candidate.\n\nIt also gives her a complete \"blank check\" on policy, objectives, etc... She's promised nothing so she can deliver anything she wants. Trump is being critiized for not debate her immediately, but how can you debate someone who has no platform? She would be debated on her previous stance as Presidential candidate in 2019 and on Biden's stance on issues and that gives her incredible leverage to dodge questions and chance stance on demand. It's Republican party has to push back on this.\n\n**Strategic replacement of Biden**\n\nI now firmly believe the only reason the Democratic party waited as long as they did to put pressure on Biden to bow out, is because they wanted to wait until after the Republican Convention and for Trump to announce his VP running mate. Well aware that the VP running mate can have impact on votes and be a way to reach otherwise unreachable demographics, they strategically positioned Harris's placement until after Trump had picked a running mate aimed at the Biden-Harris ticket.... This gives the Democrats leverage they shouldn't have.... and Biden isn't bad off enough to leave office and let Harris take over now and be held accountable for decisions she might make, they want her to have a fresh start if elected.

I\u2019ve never he\u0430rd a voice that doesn\u2019t exist. T\u0430lking is how we communicate.

Mol\u0435\u0455ting me as a child wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nThe last time He told me he was going to b\u0435at my dog. I went to pick her up, and shortly after I had to take her to the vet because her bow\u0435l movements smelled like pure bl\u0435ach.\n\nWhen I first found out he was \u0430busing Trinity \\[my dog\\], I took her from my parents custody.

I then began feeling all over her body and discovered \u201chot-spots\u201d along her back, neck and forearms as if being hit or kicked repeatedly. I took her with me outside as I cleaned out and made room in my car for her. Shortly after my \u201cbrother\u201d pulled up, looked at my dog and said \u201cYou wanna get beat again you \u0455tupid \u042citch?\u201d It took everything I had not to hurt him. I called the ASPCA and they said they couldn\u2019t do anything. I had intentions of taking her to the humane society, and some how my so called \u201cbrother\u201d found out. He informed me that if I took her there he was going to adopt her and \ud835\ude94ill her. I told him I\u2019d tell them that and he said \u201calright, I\u2019ll have some one else adopt her then i\u2019ll \ud835\ude94ill her.\u201d\n\nShortly after the first time he thr\u0435atened to \u0455hoot me in the h\u0435ad, I ov\u0435rh\u0435ard a r\u0435lative of ours (\\[REDACTED #2\\]), tell my dad, \u201cThe feds took Ronnie\u2019s gun for threatening \\[missing text\\]\n\nAside from \u0455talking me, he target\u0455 my friends as well.

My relationship interests are told that I\u2019m a \u0455talker, and that i\u2019m crazy, which couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth.

Holding a pillow over my face until I pretended to be dead because I knew if I didn\u2019t pretend that he would not stop until he smothered me as I layed still, he finally stopped\u2026He threw a weight into the deep end of the pool, I believe it was 15 or 20 lbs. Maybe 25, I don\u2019t recall. I was told to jump in and get it. And that it\u2019d be fun. I jumped in, swam down and was unable to retrieve the weight. I swam back up, and before I was able to break the surface, he held my head under the water and again I knew I was going to die if I didn\u2019t think quickly. I lunged off the side of the pool back down 8' to the bottom and in a panic I gripped the iron weight and with all my might I lunged off the bottom of the pool and frantically kicked as hard as I could while carrying the iron weight upwards. I finally broke the surface, all the while kicking, I threw the weight up and over. His tyranny did not end there. As I struggled to climb up the ladder, he pushed me back in and forced me to tread water for what felt like hours, not allowing me to rest or touch the sides of the pool. That was all before the \\[missing\\]\n\nI had hoped his time in prison would make him better, but he came out much, much worse. Shortly after his release he r\u0430ped my fiance. I didn\u2019t find out until months after her and I separated. His disgusting opening line: \u201cwhy would you wanna be with him, when you could be with me? I\u2019m an FBI agent.\u201d She said \u201cNo, your his brother.\u201d He r\u0430ped her, she said \u201cYou\u2019re going to \\[\u0184urn in\\] H\u0415LL for this!\u201d He sickly rebuttled \u201cYea I\u2019m going to H\u0415LL and it was worth it.\u201d\n\n\\[REDACTED #1\\] of whom I was with for 7 years, and have known for 10, told me Ronnie Dean Stout the 2nd was a federal \u201c\u0430g\u0435nt\u201d, but at the time she wouldn\u2019t \u0435l\u0430borate more. She\u2019s too sc\u0430red to testify \u0430gainst him judging from our last few convers\u0430tions. Ronnie Dean Stout the 2nd st\u0430lks and h\u0430r\u0430sses me on a daily basis. He has said numerous times: \u201cI\u2019m going to \u0455hoot you in the head Clay, doesn\u2019t that \u0455care you?\u201d One of his most \u0430bsurd lines is \u201cI know you hear voices you piece of \u0455hit\u201d Implying that I\u2019m cr\u0430zy. I\u2019ve never he\u0430rd a voice that doesn\u2019t exist. T\u0430lking is how we communicate. By far his most di\u0455turbing phrase \u2014 \u201cH\u0430h\u0430 you\u2019re never going to hold hands with anyone.\u201d He\u2019s been torm\u0435nting me my entire Life. Mol\u0435\u0455ting me as a child wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nThe last time He told me he was going to b\u0435at my dog. I went to pick her up, and shortly after I had to take her to the vet because her bow\u0435l movements smelled like pure bl\u0435ach.\n\nWhen I first found out he was \u0430busing Trinity \\[my dog\\], I took her from my parents custody. I walked in, she was \u0455haking like a leaf, I went to pet her and she flinched. I then began feeling all over her body and discovered \u201chot-spots\u201d along her back, neck and forearms as if being hit or kicked repeatedly. I took her with me outside as I cleaned out and made room in my car for her. Shortly after my \u201cbrother\u201d pulled up, looked at my dog and said \u201cYou wanna get beat again you \u0455tupid \u042citch?\u201d It took everything I had not to hurt him. I called the ASPCA and they said they couldn\u2019t do anything. I had intentions of taking her to the humane society, and some how my so called \u201cbrother\u201d found out. He informed me that if I took her there he was going to adopt her and \ud835\ude94ill her. I told him I\u2019d tell them that and he said \u201calright, I\u2019ll have some one else adopt her then i\u2019ll \ud835\ude94ill her.\u201d\n\nShortly after the first time he thr\u0435atened to \u0455hoot me in the h\u0435ad, I ov\u0435rh\u0435ard a r\u0435lative of ours (\\[REDACTED #2\\]), tell my dad, \u201cThe feds took Ronnie\u2019s gun for threatening \\[missing text\\]\n\nAside from \u0455talking me, he target\u0455 my friends as well. Along with my acquaintances and every single relationship interest i\u2019ve had. He bribe\u0455, threaten\u0455, and otherwise ruthle\u0455\u0455ly victimize\u0455 any one who tries to help me. My relationship interests are told that I\u2019m a \u0455talker, and that i\u2019m crazy, which couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth. When his lies don\u2019t have the desired effect, He has no problem carrying out ob\u0455cene acts of intimidation and violence. The latest target is \\[REDACTED #3\\], she and I are cruelly kept away from each other for the crime of wanting to hold each other\u2019s hand. This is merely the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the cruel and brutal antics I endure on a daily basis. I recently confronted him, and as usual he was drinking a tall can, I told him to stop stalking me, and that he was nothing less than an absolute monst\u0435r. I now have torn ligaments in my left shoulder due to the altercation that ensured. Ronnie Dean Stout the 2nd is either pretending to be a federal agent to get away with pure evil. Or this is the cruelest FBI informant/\u201cagent\u201d i've ever had the absolute misfortune of meeting. I have also heard my dad tell my \u201cbrother\u201d, You never should of taken that deal with the feds\u201d. Ronnie Dean Stout the 2nd Replied \u201cI had to or else I\u2019d be doing another (30/40)\\] years\u201d\n\nI as well as \\[REDACTED #3\\], need to be protected from the d\u0435rang\u0435d cruelty of the monst\u0435r known as Ronnie Dean Stout the 2nd. He has also admitted to putting \u0455tyrofoam/liquid absorbents in the fuel tank of my car. intentionally ripp\u0435d out the charging port of my MP3 player, along with countle\u0455\u0455 other \u042cully tactic\u0455. He\u2019s got some sort of sick d\u0435m\u0435nt\u0435d \u0435nvious wrath aimed towards me, and he needs help. I will gladly polygraph to any of my t\u0435stimony. And it\u2019d be in the public\u2019s interest to polygraph him on the matter as well. Last, but not least, he replaced the water in my canteen with antifr\u0435\u0435z\u0435. Before I r\u0435aliz\u0435d it was no longer water I had drank some and I got very sick. He said I should drink it and build up my immunities to it. I missed my welding class that night because I had to go to the hospital.

I lost faith in the Democratic Party but still wanted Biden to win over Trump.\n\nFast forward to now, I\u2019m voting for Trump. We have had a presidency with Trump and we have had a presidency with Biden. The damage that Biden is doing almost feels irreparable. Millions of illegal immigrants and severe economical damage\u2026 it was also disheartening to realize how much I had been lied to. I also have come to realize how much social media and the news played a role in my exposure to information. It almost felt as if the people or the news had the final say of what really happened, whether it pertained to Jan 6, BLM, convictions, etc.. but I\u2019ve come to see that I was duped on many things.\n\nThe point I\u2019m getting at is that I wished Sanders could have been the Democratic president so we had a true chance for socialism. I always had seen sanders as a man of honesty and principle, but Biden is undoubtedly a pathological liar and compromised (laundered money). Intentionally letting in millions of immigrants\u2026 with many likely to vote. Life feels unaffordable. And Sanders still endorsed him? Maybe Sanders isn\u2019t the person I thought he was. Idk. And you know fucking what, Harris represents all of this as well. And the party which claims to be fighting to save democracy has bypassed a fair primary election to place Harris as the rightful nominee. The Democratic Party has lost any loyalty I had.\n\nLook, Trump isn\u2019t our Lord and Savior, but he\u2019s the guy we could benefit from right now. I definitely have my criticisms of the Republican Party, mainly being the strong tie to Christianity they cling to. Regardless, progressivism has gotten to the point of digression and we need some American priority and pride. I\u2019m sorry for judging conservatives/republicans so harshly in the past.

Below you will find a synopsis of Tim Walz's failures, and why he is a menace to Minnesota and will be for the United States if elected.\n\n**Frauds, and Mismanagement of Taxpayer Funds**\n\nWalz and the Democrat Farmer-Labor (DFL in Minnesota) have blown out spending during Walz's tenure.\n\n* [Minnesota issued $428mil in unemployment overpayments during the pandemic.](https://alphanews.org/report-says-minnesota-overpaid-430-million-in-unemployment-benefits-across-three-years/)\n\n* [Minnesota distributed $10mil in fradulent Medicare claims](https://alphanews.org/five-twin-cities-residents-charged-in-over-10m-medicaid-fraud/)\n\n* [Of the individuals who applied for the frontline worker payments, only 60% were confirmed as eilgible](https://alphanews.org/audit-500-million-covid-program-eligible-minnesotans/)\n\n* [Feeding our Future, given funds with the oversight of the Minnesota Department of Education, defrauded the government of over $250mil](https://alphanews.org/commentary-the-dfls-250-million-coverup/)\n\n**Why is this important?**\n\n* Under the oversight of Walz, not a single head of department who so grossly mismanaged distribution of these taxpayer dollars has been held accountable. Specifically during the Feeding our Future food fraud scandal, fraudulent distribution sites were claiming to be feeding thousands of children per day in towns where the population was not possible to have met their claims. These numbers were not verified, and truly nothing was verified resulting in this massive fraud. \n\n**Budget and Overspending**\n\nIn 2022-2023, the State of Minnesota carried a $17.5bil budget surplus. An incredibly exorbitant surplus, signaling significant over-taxation of the population. What was done with this surplus? \n\n* Governor Walz promised during his campaign a $2,000 rebate check with the surplus for joint tax filers, and $1,000 for single filers. The MN DFL then reduced that number to $550 for joint filers, and $275 for single filers. Ultimately, it was settled on $260 for single filers, and $520 for joint filers. Governor Walz promised this check wouldn't be taxed. [It was subsequently taxed by the federal government, and had to be claimed on this year's tax filings.](https://alphanews.org/democrats-trim-rebate-checks-down-to-260-per-filer/)\n\n* Normally, you would expect a significant surplus to allow for lasting tax cuts given such a surplus would give the State a cushion for spending. However, under Walz, nearly the entire surplus was spent on new and existing programs, which are not one time expenditures, raising the biennium spending baseline by $14bil. [This money won't just pop up out of thin air, so what does that mean? More taxation.](https://www.americanexperiment.org/where-minnesotas-17-5-billion-surplus-went-a-series/)\n\n**Failures during George Floyd riots**\n\n* [Governor Walz failed as a leader by hesitating to deploy the National Guard to the streets of Minneapolis to control rioting after the death of George Floyd. A very detailed account can be found here](https://www.americanexperiment.org/the-truth-about-gov-walz-and-the-national-guard/)\n\n**Cushy lifestyle**\n\n* Governor Walz was residing in the governor's mansion, but decided it needed some renovations. The original budget for the renovations was around $7mil, but suddenly jumped to double that number, between $13-$14mil. Who's footing that bill you ask? The Minnesota taxpayer. Where is Governor Walz in the meantime? He's living in the mansion that houses the president of the University of Minnesota, which carries a $4,400 a month rent bill. Also covered by the taxpayer. \n\nIn summary, Tim Walz is an utter disaster for the State of Minnesota. He has drained the bank accounts of many, while allowing his own cities to burn, and has the audacity to pretend to be some folksy do gooder who enjoys hunting, fishing, and is an every man. He is nothing more than a wolf in sheep's clothing. He is a fraud and a phony who is down with the revolution, and is prepared to continue the destruction of this once great nation.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1eliblh/a_synopsis_of_tim_walz/"}

It's pretty disgusting.\n\n  \nAmongst the other provisions of this section of the law that were deleted at the time of the above change (can be seen in the first link) was one that defined a \"born alive infant\" and this one that allowed the parent of the child who died post-abortion to take legal action against the abortion provider in the case of negligence. \n\n*Civil and disciplinary actions.*\n\n\u00a0(a) **Any person upon whom an abortion has been performed**, or the parent or guardian of the mother if the mother is a minor, and the abortion results in the infant having been born alive, **may maintain an action for death of or injury to the born alive infant against the person who performed the abortion** if the death or injury was a result of simple negligence, gross negligence, wantonness, willfulness, intentional conduct, or another violation of the legal standard of care.\n\n(b) **Any responsible medical personnel that does not take all reasonable measures consistent with good medical practice to preserve the life and health of the born alive infant**, as required by subdivision 1, **may be subject to the suspension or revocation of that person's professional license** by the professional board with authority over that person. Any person who has performed an abortion and against whom judgment has been rendered pursuant to paragraph (a) shall be subject to an automatic suspension of the person's professional license for at least one year and said license shall be reinstated only after the person's professional board requires compliance with this section by all board licensees.\n\n(c) Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to hold the mother of the born alive infant criminally or civilly liable for the actions of a physician, nurse, or other licensed health care provider in violation of this section to which the mother did not give her consent.\n\n# \n\n  \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1emer31/the_abortion_bill_tim_walz_signed_in_2023_removed/"}

I am so tired of the lies from democrats on here.\n\nRecently there was a post from PA that showed democrats trying to condition the population to think that there's nothing nefarious about late election results. They rightfully got destroyed in the twitter comments.\n\nBut miraculously when I look on this sub what do the top comments say? They spread the democrat talking point that the reason they can't count ballots on time like everyone else is because they can't process ballots **BEFORE** election day and when Democrats proposed a bill to do this Republicans rejected it.\n\nWell let's look at the facts here.\n\n\n**Claim # 1 - We can't count in one day:**\n\nA quick back of the envelope calculation proves this wrong. PA has over 9000 polling locations. At a mere 5 workers per lets say that's 50k election workers. For context Philly has something like over 8000 poll workers. PA had around 2.5 mil mail ballots in 2020. Let's say they have 3 million. At a **FULL MINUTE** per ballot, to finish processing these in **JUST 6 HOURS** you would need only 8k workers. This is fully within the scope of resources for PA to do easily. We can see it right here with our own eyes that they are lying when they claim they cannot do it in a day and make these excuses.\n\nWe also have examples of election systems that do **FAR MORE** work to count each ballot and yet they have no trouble getting their results in fast. Taiwan is a great example they literally hold up ballots and count them one by one out loud to a room full of people that can watch and film the entire process and they easily finish it in one day. There are also other states that (like PA) don't allow counting until election day and they have no problem getting their results on time.\n\n\n**Claim #2 - Democrats tried to fix this but Republicans rejected it:**\n\nThe democrat house did pass a bill. And they poison pilled it. The entire purpose was just to get fake headlines to fool low info voters like all the top comments on reddit the other day with thousands of upvotes. All those people were wrong and manipulated by disinformation, and even worse they will gladly vote for the people who lied to them.\n\nNow for the facts about the bill. Not only did democrats refuse to put any limits on when ballots need to be counted by, but they also **LIFTED ALL REQUIREMENTS** on when to start counting. This would allow democrats in areas to start counting days after the election. There is no reason why they would have done this if they were serious about election integrity. Being able to look at ballots early by the way is also a tool to rig elections, as is the ability to wait and \"count\" later. This bill tried to expand both. The idea that this would have improved election integrity and trust in elections is a flat out lie. It would have done precisely the opposite.\n\nThere is no shortage of evidence of democrats taking actions in the state of PA to reduce election transparency and security. They will even tell you right to your face their policy is that if signatures don't match you aren't allowed to challenge a ballot. So what's the point of the signature? Just to play pretend? Democrats have done nothing but obstruct common sense requests for basic election information and security. Those who try to paint the opposite narrative on here are flat out liars.\n\nThat is all.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1eraav4/debunking_democrat_lies_about_pa_elections/"}

Now the terrorists are all back, as are Russia, China and Iran. And inflation, unemployment and crime are rampant. In addition, under President Trump the US reduced carbon emissions more than any country in the Paris Accord. EVERY BAD THING THEY SAID WOULD HAPPEN UNDER TRUMP (NONE OF WHICH EVER OCCURRED) HAS ACTUALLY OCCURRED UNDER BIDEN AND HARRIS.\u00a0 SO IF YOU WERE OPPOSED TO TRUMP FOR THOSE REASONS WHICH NEVER ACTUALLY OCCURRED, THEN THERE IS ZERO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD EVER VOTE FOR BIDEN, HARRIS OR ANY DEMOCRAT AGAIN.\u00a0 Unless of course you are just a hypocrite filled with hate and your words mean nothing \u2013 and everything that is occurring in this country is very much your fault as well.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMore Americans are tapping their 401(k) accounts because of financial distress.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEVEN THE NON-PARTISAN CONGRSSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE DEFINITIVELY CONFIRMED THAT BIDEN, HARRIS AND THE DEMS ARE TO BLAME FOR INFLATION, NOT PUTIN.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAND NO - IT IS NOT BECAUSE OF \"RECOVERY FROM THE PANDEMIC\" - THAT WOULD ONLY BE TRUE IF THE PRICES OF SUCH GOODS WERE NOW AT PRE-PANDEMIC LEVELS, BUT THESE PRICES ARE EXPONENTIALLY HIGHER.\n\n\u00a0\n\nINFLATION \u2013 INCLUDING GAS PRICES \u2013 WAS SOARING WAY BEFORE RUSSIA/UKRAINE. This was a direct result of Biden\u2019s, Harris' and the democrats\u2019 draconian policies, rampant spending, ridiculously prohibitive and expensive regulations, and massive tax increases, and now they are trying to use the war to sweep it under the rug. In addition to the fact that the massive spike in gas prices began way before Russia/Ukraine, inflation on ALL goods had already been soaring throughout the country \u2013 food, building materials, gas, consumer goods, etc. \u2013 AND NOW THERE IS A FOOD AND A BABY FORMULA SHORTAGE \u2013 and NONE OF ANY OF THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA. Yes \u2013 gas prices will increase even further now as a result of the war (and only gas \u2013 the war has no impact on the prices of any other goods that are now at historical inflationary levels), but they will increase off of an already ridiculously historically high inflationary basis that was in place before the war even began!\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhile President Trump created the GREATEST economy US HISTORY (and the demographic which benefitted the most from President Trump's policies was the Black community), since Biden occupied the White House he and Harris created the WORST economy since the Depression \u2013 far worse than the economy he inherited, an economic crisis, an unemployment crisis, a border crisis, an energy crisis (we were completely energy independent under President Trump and didn\u2019t buy our gas from anyone else \u2013 GAS PRICES WERE SKYROCKETING UNDER BIDEN\u2019S AND HARRIS\u2019 POLICIES WAY BEFORE RUSSIA/UKRAINE), a foreign policy crisis, terrorist organizations such as ISIS, the Taliban and Al Qaeda have regained strength (and our enemies such as Russia, Iran and China now perceive us as being weak!), crime and murders at an all-time high, a racial crisis, and a country on the brink of civil war. In short \u2013 a massive crisis of our democracy as our country has now become a socialist\u2019s haven under fascist rule.\n\n\u00a0\n\nInflation is now soaring \u2013 gas prices, consumer products, construction products such as lumber (which has a direct impact on home ownership). We have gone from complete energy independence under President Trump to gas shortages and lines at the pump and complete dependence upon other countries (it seems that we have regressed 50 years back to the 1970s). Unemployment is soaring. Biden\u2019s and Harris\u2019 policies have literally destroyed millions of jobs. This country is on fire (quite literally in a great many cities \u2013 and Biden and the dems seem fit to not only allow it to happen, but encourage it, allowing the Antifa/BLM terrorists burning down the cities to go free while going after political enemies with tactics that cannot be described as anything short of gestapo partisan tactics).\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor those of you who voted for Biden and Harris, do you still not yet see your massive mistake and how you have contributed to the destruction of this country??? This is your doing. Furthermore, the deaths of all those Afghan people - and all of the Americans who will be killed in future terror attacks that would have never occurred under President Trump - is not just on Biden's and Harris\u2019 heads - but yours as well, along with any other ignorant fascist who voted for them.\n\n  \n[https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-price-control-plan-cause-bread-lines-recreate-the-walking-dead-economy-cnn-commentator](https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-price-control-plan-cause-bread-lines-recreate-the-walking-dead-economy-cnn-commentator)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1f7qc6n/harris_price_control_plan_will_cause_bread_lines/"}

Surprising results.", "body": "tldr; ChatGPT says: **Degree of Bias**: **The degree of negative bias in Vance\u2019s interview can be considered significant** in comparison to Harris\u2019s interview. The difference lies in the intensity of the questioning, the focus on controversies, and the lack of moments that allow for a more personal connection to the interviewee.\n\n--\n\nRegardless of what you think about AI, if correctly used, I believe it can be a neutral arbiter of questions of bias in humans. Politics is perhaps the most divisive area of our country so I took\u00a0[this interview](https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/sotu/date/2024-08-11/segment/01)\u00a0of Dana Bash and JD Vance and\u00a0[this interview](https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/se/date/2024-08-30/segment/19)\u00a0of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz with Dana Bash and uploaded them to ChatGPT asking only:\n\n>\n\n>act as an unbiased expert on media bias, I'm going to give you the transcript of two interviews each conducted by \"BASH\" and I want you to identify any differences between the two interviews that would indicate bias. Are you ready for interview one?\n\nThis was ChatGPT's response:\n\nBased on the transcripts you provided, here are some key differences that might indicate bias or differences in approach in the interviews conducted by Dana Bash:\n\n1. **Tone and Confrontation**:\n   * **Vance's Interview**: The tone appears more confrontational and challenging, with Bash pressing Vance on various statements and inconsistencies, such as his views on military service, his attacks on opponents, and his alignment with Donald Trump. This interview contains numerous follow-up questions challenging Vance's statements and positions.\n   * **Harris's Interview**: The tone seems less confrontational. Bash's questions are direct but less aggressive compared to the Vance interview. The discussion also moves swiftly from potentially sensitive topics, like the comment about Harris \"turning black,\" to policy-focused questions without much probing into personal controversies.\n2. **Content Focus**:\n   * **Vance's Interview**: There's a significant focus on personal attacks, controversies, and Vance's criticisms of his political opponents, which dominates the conversation. Bash frequently challenges Vance on his previous statements and political positions.\n   * **Harris's Interview**: The questions are more centered on policy issues, Harris's personal reactions to political developments, and her stances on international matters. The personal challenges are fewer, and the controversies around Harris are addressed but not dwelt upon extensively.\n3. **Personal and Emotional Appeals**:\n   * **Vance's Interview**: The interview has moments where Vance's personal life and military service are discussed, but these are often framed within the context of political attacks or controversies.\n   * **Harris's Interview**: There's a noticeable inclusion of personal and emotional elements, such as the discussion of Harris's family and the impactful photo of her niece. These moments are presented in a way that humanizes Harris and shifts focus away from purely political or controversial aspects.\n4. **Response Handling**:\n   * **Vance's Interview**: Bash is persistent in seeking clarifications and pushing back against Vance\u2019s responses, particularly when discussing his criticisms of others and his alignment with Donald Trump.\n   * **Harris's Interview**: Bash allows Harris to guide the conversation more, especially in how she wishes to frame her political stances and personal anecdotes. The pushback is notably milder compared to Vance's interview.\n\nThese differences could suggest a variance in interviewing style based on the subject's responses or potentially an underlying bias in how each interview is structured and conducted, focusing more on controversy in one and policy in the other. However, the actual intent behind these differences would require further analysis of a broader range of interviews to definitively conclude bias.\n\nI then asked it:\n\n>Based just on these transcripts alone, choose the interview that was more biased negatively and to which degree you see the difference of bias\n\nTo which it responded:\n\nBased solely on the transcripts provided, the interview with J.D. Vance appears more negatively biased compared to the interview with Kamala Harris. Here\u2019s a breakdown of how this bias manifests and the degree of difference:\n\n1. **Confrontational Questions**: The interview with Vance features a more confrontational approach with repeated challenges and a focus on controversy. Bash presses Vance on his previous statements, political attacks, and controversies, often using a tone that demands justification and correction of perceived inconsistencies. This contrasts with the Harris interview, where Bash\u2019s tone is more neutral and focused on policy without as much personal or controversial probing.\n2. **Focus on Controversy and Attacks**: Vance's interview is heavily centered on his criticisms of opponents and his alignment with controversial figures like Donald Trump. These topics are pursued with persistence and often framed in a manner that seems designed to highlight conflicts and controversies. In contrast, Harris's interview, while it does touch on controversial topics (like her comment about turning black and policy on Israel), quickly moves to broader policy discussions and personal narratives that cast her in a more sympathetic or relatable light.\n3. **Emotional and Personal Content**: In Harris's interview, there is a clear effort to humanize her through discussions about her family and emotional moments, which are absent in Vance\u2019s interview. Instead, Vance's personal elements are often linked to political controversies or criticisms, which does not afford him the same personal connection with the audience that Harris receives.\n4. **Degree of Bias**: **The degree of negative bias in Vance\u2019s interview can be considered significant** in comparison to Harris\u2019s interview. The difference lies in the intensity of the questioning, the focus on controversies, and the lack of moments that allow for a more personal connection to the interviewee.\n\nThese elements combined suggest that the interview with J.D. Vance was conducted in a more negatively biased manner, focusing on controversy and conflict, whereas Kamala Harris\u2019s interview allowed more space for policy exposition and personal storytelling, contributing to a less confrontational and more balanced presentation.\n\nNote: I only uploaded the text portion of their interviews and not the intro or subsequent follow-up interviews with other parties included in the transcripts.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1f90exe/i_uploaded_the_dana_bash_cnn_interview/"}

And after passing a bill outlawing free speech in California, he would make sure no one could make fun of him about it.\n\nHis latest proposal would tax the exhaling of more than 3 breaths per minute. As everyone who follows the science knows, humans exhale CO2 (Carbon DiOxide) with every single breath. So decreasing the amount of exhalations would decrease CO2 in the atmosphere.\n\nThe proposed bill states that anyone caught exhaling more than 3 times each minute would be taxed for each additional breath. Each successive breath above 3 per minute would double the tax rate. Naturally, there would be tiers. Once someone has used double the amount of the per minute breath exhalation allotment, their tax rate will triple. \n\nBecause California is progressive state, and Governor Newsome has seen all of Kamala Harris' interviews, he has his eyes on the national 2028 scene. To that end, he does not want to be seen favoring those who can financially afford to exhale more often. This would typically include other politicians and Hollywood actors who usually spend a lot of time \"informing\" we plebeians what we should be thinking and how. No, he wants to ensure equality for all.\n\nIn that vein, he has included a penalty clause. Anyone caught using triple their per minute breath exhalation rate - on average - for a full 24 hour period would be subject to the penalty clause. This would allow those mothers who are giving birth, athletes who are exercising, as well as  politicians and actors pontificating plenty of time to complete their activities and be taxed accordingly.\n\nThe penalty clause would require anyone caught using triple their per minute breath exhalation rate - on average - for a full 24 hour period to have a mandatory 1 hour no exhalation period. To show how compassionate California is, there would be no additional taxes during this no exhalation period.\n\nThe CA Dept of Revenue expects initial tax receipts to be in the billions of dollars in the first week with revenues dwindling rapidly as revenue sources somehow diminish and disappear. Revenue agents are uncertain as to what to the causes of these losses may be.\n\nSome question whether the governor can garner the votes for such a proposal. But after hunting down an individual surfer who was alone, and away from everyone during the COVID lockdown, and then putting him in jail with others, nothing seems beyond the capabilities of the California state.\n\nThere are some voices of concern, primarily from Orange County. Of all the people interviewed about this proposal, only some Hindu monks in San Francisco stated that they do not believe that they would be impacted by this new law whatsoever.\n\nIf you are having a hard time determining if this is a parody, that is understandable.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1fn4tum/governor_newsome_proposes_less_co2_emissions_from/"}

Sources within the DNC have confirmed that the new headquarters will feature VIP seating for donors, with a strict no-regulars policy.\n\n\u201cWe love the idea of running our operations out of a place where we can curate the crowd,\u201d said [renowned grill master](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13537187/Chuck-Schumer-grill-cheeseburger-barbecue-daughter.html) Chuck Schumer. \u201cIt\u2019s like a campaign rally but with more grease and less actual democracy. Plus, who doesn\u2019t want to strategize over a mountain of fries?\u201d\n\nCritics are already lining up to decry the decision, with many claiming it undermines the very spirit of grassroots politics. But the DNC remains unfazed. \u201cWe\u2019re just keeping it real\u2014like our sandwiches,\u201d said one insider, smirking while holding a Primanti Bros menu. \u201cYou know, stacked high and full of flavor, just like our ideals\u2026 or at least the ones we choose to highlight.\u201d\n\nIn a twist of irony, the DNC plans to host a \u201cNo More Vance\u201d night at the Primanti Bros location, where supporters can enjoy special discounts while chanting slogans designed to exclude any opposing views. \u201cIt\u2019s about unity,\u201d insisted Harrison. \u201cAnd nothing brings people together like a shared hatred for anyone who doesn\u2019t agree with us!\u201d\n\nAs of now, the DNC has issued a warm welcome to Primanti Bros, heralding the new headquarters as a revolutionary step toward a future where political rallies can take place alongside lunch orders. \u201cWhy just campaign when you can \u2018sandwich\u2019 your opposition?\u201d joked Schumer. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win for all of us!\u201d", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1fswnhp/primanti_bros_location_named_new_dnc_headquarters/"}

Ultimately, it was our decision whether or not to take content down, and we own our decisions, including COVID-19-related changes we made to our enforcement in the wake of this pressure. I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it. I also think we made some choices that, with the benefit of hindsight and new information, we wouldn't make today. Like I said to our teams at the time, I feel strongly that we should not compromise our content standards due to pressure from any Administration in either direction - and we're ready to push back if something like this happens again.\u201d\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fujpxh"}

As a disclaimer, I don't consider my as a conservative. I'm slightly to the left of centre, but I have a very strong interest in US politics. Unfortunately, there are not many places to productively discuss this data besides another subreddit that I use. Most of reddit will not productively discuss this\n\nI am going to be using data from **Gallup** to explain why this race strongly favours Trump. Yes, I know the polling is showing a tight race... but there are strong indicators that Trump may be in the best position he's ever been in\n\nFor those unaware, Gallup is the father of the polling industry. They are the best at capturing the mood of an electorate and conduct large high quality surveys **dating back to the 1940s.** They were off the mark in their 2012 horse racing polling, but when they conduct surveys based on **fundamentals**, i.e. what voters think of issues, etc, they have a very strong track record with predicting elections\n\nNow without further ado, let's start.\n\n---------------\n\n**The electorate is R+3**\n\nhttps://news.gallup.com/poll/651092/2024-election-environment-favorable-gop.aspx\n\nAccording to Gallup's article last month, there are now more registered republicans than demcorats. Some may be skeptical of this, but this data actually passes the smell test when you look at new registrations. Republicans are outregistering democrats **nationwide** across every major state. Currently, Gallup has it as R48 to D45\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fezc6hslgysqd1.png%3Fwidth%3D1024%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D7d28245c8190a441b5d9cfcc0c26c0393e690dad\n\nNow why is this significant? Gallup's electorate projections in the past, have correlated to the share of the popular vote. As you can see from the graph above, here's how their projected party ID's aligned with the national popular vote:\n\n- 2008: D+8, Obama popular vote = 7.2%\n\n- 2012: D+4, Obama popular vote = 3.9%\n\n- 2016: D+2, Clinton popular vote = 2.1%\n\n- 2020: D+5, Biden popular vote = 4.5%\n\n- 2024: R+3, Trump popular vote = ?\n\nAs you can see, the popular vote ends up being a point or two less than the projected electorate. Which would indicate a Trump popular vote win of 1-2 points. Which statistically, is a 100% guarantee of an electoral college victory. As you can see, Gallup actually underestimated the GOP a little in the Bush years with the party ID\n\nSo it would require Gallup's electorate to be off by 4-5 for Harris to be +2 nationally. Even with a reduced electoral college bias, Harris still needs some 2.5-3pt win to be even in the electoral college\n\nTrump winning the popular vote this cycle isn't as outlandish as you think, when you consider that **many** polls this year have indicated this. AtlasIntel, the most accurate pollster of 2020 (were only 0.2% off the mark in predicting Biden's popular vote margin) are predicting a Trump +2.9 popular vote win. Other pollsters such as Quinipiac have Trump +1, and even left leaning pollsters such as NBC and CNN have the popular vote as  **tie**. Pew Research, which is the most accurate in terms of demographics, has Harris only +1 nationally. NYT's two September polls have the popular vote as a tie\n\nFor reference, a Harris +1 popular vote win is almost assuredly a Trump electoral college win\n\nMoving on...\n\n**Gallup's survey question which asks which party would better tackle the top issue, has predicted every election since 1948**\n\nIn every presidential cycle since 1948, with the exception of 2000, Gallup has asked ''which party would better tackle the top issue facing the country?''. You can see the graph below in the link\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fk97w4wa039rd1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D432%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D24dc753e096718007d65065ab1b8c90dcf77e875\n\nIn 2012, the democrats had a 10 point advantage on this question, and Obama went on to win the election. In 2016, the GOP had a 4 point advantage. In 2020, the democrats had an 8 point advantage. In 2024, the figure stands at a 5 point advantage for the GOP\n\nAs you can see, the party which has the advantage on this question, goes on to win the white house in every presidential cycle since 1948. The only anamloy I can see here is 1980, where for some reason, the parties were tied \n\n**The economy is by far the biggest issue in this election, and it's nearing 2008 levels according to Gallup**\n\n https://news.gallup.com/poll/651719/economy-important-issue-2024-presidential-vote.aspx\n\nAs you can see in the below chart, the economy is the most important it's been since 2008. In 2008, 55% of Americans saw it as extremely important. In the yeras since, the number was always below the 50 mark. Today, it stands at 52%\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fym1ker37zqtd1.png%3Fwidth%3D1024%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D2e996fe601ea5cec002a8bf7623a7abda1a68731\n\nAccording to Gallup, Trump has a 9 point lead on the economy and immigration. Also important is that this article strongly suggests that the number of ''never Trumpers'' is waaay overexaggerated. The economy is rated so highly because it's split on partisan lines. Unlike 2008, far more republicans are concerned about the economy than dems... **but** 97% of republicans support Trump on the economy\n\nThis is very good news for Trump, because it indicates he has near universal support on the single issue which is **by far** the most important to republicans. Democracy does not even break into the top 5 issues for republicans\n\nHere are other takeaways from Gallup's data:\n\nhttps://news.gallup.com/610757/2024-presidential-election-center.aspx\n\n**US Satisfaction**\n\n**Metric Overview:** This indicator shows the percentage of Americans satisfied with the country's current direction. U.S. satisfaction is a key measure of the public's desire for change in an upcoming election\n\n**Survey Question:** In general, are you satisfied or dissatisfied with the way things are going in the United States at this time?\n\nHow does this correlate to the winner of a presidential election? Below, I will post the satisfaction number today and what the numbers were in the years that the incumbent party won and lost re-election\n\nUS satisfaction, as of 12th October 2024: -22\n\n**US satisfaction number in the years the incumbent party lost re-election**\n\n- **1980** - 19%\n\n- **1992** - 22%\n\n- **2000** - 62%\n\n- **2008** - 13%\n\n- **2016** - 37%\n\n- **2020** - 28%\n\n**US satisfaction number in the years the incumbent party won re-election**\n\n**1984** - 48%\n\n**1988** - 56%\n\n**1996** - 39%\n\n**2004** - 44%\n\n**2012** - 33%\n\n**What's the takeaway here?** \n\nAs you can see, what stands out is that in the years 2000, satisfaction was actually quite high. But Gore still lost.. similar case in 2016. However, both elections were very close in spite of that. The elections were likely very close *because* the satisfaction wasn't so bad. Al Gore, and to a lesser extent, Hilary Clinton, were boosted by the coat-tails of the popular incumbent leader. It's also very difficult for an incumbent party to win three consecutive elections\n\nSo we have examples where the candidate for the incumbent party can lose, in spite of satisfaction being average to good. \n\n**However**, we do not yet have an example of a presidential election where the candidate of the incumbent party has won an election when the US satisfaction was so low. **The current 22% figure represents the worst figure since 1992 (22%) and is similar to 1980 (19%)**\n\nAside from US satisfaction, Gallup has other metric to compare with\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**Economic confidence**\n\n**Metric Overview:** This measure combines Americans' views on current economic conditions and their view of the economy's direction to produce an index value ranging from +100 (optimal confidence) to -100 (complete pessimism).\n\n**Why This Matters:** Voters often look to the economy when assessing how the nation is doing and how well elected leaders are performing their jobs. The economy is usually one of the top election issues.\n\nAs of today, the economic confidence index stands at -28\n\n**The economic confidence index in years in which the incumbent party lost re-election**\n\n**1992:** -37\n\n**2000:** +44\n\n**2008:** -72\n\n**2016:** -1\n\n**2020:** -4\n\n**The economic confidence index in years in which the incumbent party won re-election**\n\n**1996:** +23\n\n**2004:** +1\n\n**2012:** -1\n\n**What's the takeaway here?** \n\nSimilar theme, the incumbent parties have lost with a positive number in elections where it would represent the third consecutive term (2000 and 2016). In the years outside of that, the incumbent party has won when the number doesn't become too underwater\n\nAn incumbent party has never won re-election when economic confidence is all the way into the minus twenties. Such a figure is closer to 1992 and sizeably worse than 2020\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Job approval and how it correlates to popular vote share**\n\n**Metric Overview:** This indicator shows the percentage of Americans approving of the incumbent president's job performance.\n\n**Why This Matters:** Job approval ratings close to Election Day are highly predictive of whether incumbent presidents are reelected.\n\nThe incumbent party's job approval has often aligned with the share of the popular vote they receive\n\n**1984** - Raegan job approval (58%), popular vote share (58.8%)\n\n**1992** - H.W Bush job approval (34%), popular vote share (37.4%)\n\n**1996** - Bill Clinton job approval (54%), popular vote share (49.2% - although Ross Perot had 8.4% of the PV here as a 3rd party)\n\n**2004** - George Bush job approval (48%), popular vote share (50.7%)\n\n**2012** - Barack Obama job approval (52%), popular vote share (51.1%)\n\n**2020** - Donald Trump job approval (46%), popular vote share (46.8%)\n\n**2024** - Joe Biden job approval (currently 42%)\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Kamala is assessed by Biden's job approval numbers, as was the case with Walter Mondale when he ran in 1984\n\nOn 538's approval average for Kamala, she was sub 40% until she accepted the nomination and shot up 5% within a 2 week period (which to me, clearly looks like response bias). She's currently holding steady at around 45.4% on the 538 average. The latest YouGov poll gave her some poor numbers with RV and LV's on job approval (in the 41-43% range)\n\nAs a reference point, Biden's approval was quite high when he took office (54%) but plumetted below 50% when inflation hit in the summer of 2021. Since then, it never recovered and has stayed underwater in the high 30s to low 40s range ever since\n\nhttps://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/joe-biden/\n\nThis metric isn't always fully in sync with the PV share, but as you can see, there's some correlation\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**In conclusion**, the fundamnetals are strongly on his side and several polls released today seem to back this data up. On NBC and ABC's poll, more voters viewed the Trump presidency favourable than Biden\n\nI think the fact that the fundamnetals are so strongly on his side is very good news for him. But we will see\n\nThanks for reading!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1g30ly5/the_fundamentals_of_this_race_strongly_favour/"}

However, I also recognize that my spiritual growth has deepened during President Biden\u2019s term. I find myself reflecting on a number of concerns that I believe are impacting the nation:\n\n**Border Security:**\u00a0I am deeply concerned about the current state of our border. It\u2019s not just about immigration\u2014it's about the ripple effects we're seeing: increases in crime, human trafficking (including the tragic reality of child sex trafficking), drug trafficking, and the presence of dangerous actors who could pose serious security risks. It\u2019s also affecting job availability and housing affordability for American citizens. The deficit spending is staggering, and I believe these problems are exacerbated by individuals entering the country who shouldn\u2019t be here.\n\n**The Economy:**\u00a0Tariffs, while sometimes controversial, can be a practical measure to protect American workers. Our economy is in an unbalanced state, with international corporations seemingly benefitting more than the average American worker. It's disheartening to see how much the U.S. appears to have been taken advantage of by global conglomerates. When I think about our food supply, entertainment, and media\u2014so much of it feels like it's designed to distract and harm rather than uplift us. Meanwhile, our national debt continues to grow, and the wealth disparity seems to have only increased, benefiting the rich and powerful.\n\n**Cultural and Religious Concerns:**\u00a0The decline in respect for traditional Christian values and moral foundations is troubling to me. I don\u2019t understand why so much of our culture seems focused on destructive, low-energy, and entitled attitudes. I wonder if the far left realizes the dangers of indulging in vices that ultimately weaken us as a society. When people become hardened to values that build strong communities, it impacts every aspect of life.\n\n**Global Conflicts and National Security:**\u00a0I believe we are not as safe as we once were. Conflicts in the Middle East, Europe, and Asia are escalating, and I fear these situations could easily spiral into wider wars. I\u2019ve always felt a strong inclination to support Israel, but I am deeply concerned about the possibility of a broader conflict where the U.S. is stretched thin across multiple fronts. Israel, in particular, seems to be in a vulnerable position with its arsenal greatly diminished. And while I support Israel\u2019s right to defend itself, I do believe Netanyahu could have shown more restraint in Gaza. It's hard not to notice that much of this unrest did not occur under Trump, whose sanctions on Iran likely helped prevent events like the tragic Oct. 7 attack.\n\n**Future Premonitions:**\u00a0If a Democrat remains in office, I worry that we could see the outbreak of World War III, possibly alongside internal unrest or even civil war in the U.S. The legal frameworks allowing the government to act with extreme force against its own citizens were put in place during the Biden administration\u2014not under Trump. On the other hand, if a Republican is in office, I believe we may face an economic recession but avoid a larger global war, with increased focus on dealing with cartel-related violence in Mexico and South America. This is the sense I have right now.\n\nI hope we can find ways to support one another through these uncertain times. May you continue to find strength and peace, and may those you love be blessed and protected by the goodness you carry in your heart.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1g5t8cg/my_solemn_thoughts_on_the_us_2024_election/"}

Historical Trends: Past election outcomes and voting patterns can provide insight into potential future results.\n3. Candidate Dynamics: Factors like a candidate's popularity, campaign performance, and controversies play a role.\n4.

That has what the USA seem to always been, until recently just in a couple years, I felt that the democracy inside USA has began failing. I couldn't publicly tell people that I support a certain party, I am afraid that I might not even make it to a college that I wanted because of who I support politicially on social media. I am afarid that even when I do graduate college, that big companies would simply not employ me because of my political status.\n\nI also haven't heard the term also politically correct until the recent years. Now, lots of media outlets has been telling people, this is the \"right\" person to vote for. This is the person you \"should\" vote for. Then, another person is the \"wrong\" persont to vote for, the one you \"shouldn't vote for\", this is the \"politically incorrect\" person.\n\nThere has never been a time inside a \"democratic\" country like this, a time where people are afraid to publicly express their opinions afraid of being oppressed. There wasn't a time where almost all the big media companies told people who to vote for. There has never been a time where **the people** were told that one party are evil.\n\nI am still curious, if the founding fathers saw what country the USA become today, would they still be proud of it? Would they still have any pride in the country that they built with blood and sweat?\n\n### All I want, is to live in a world where I wouldn't be oppressed by my political opinion, a world where a certain political party are not portrayed as the enemy of **\"The People\"**. A world where I am not being told by the media who \"the right one\" is to vote for.\n\nThe best way to stay in power is to make your citizens fight, then they will stop realizing the bad the ruler have done. \"A prince must imitate the fox and the lion, for the lion cannot protect himself from traps, and the fox cannot defend himself from wolves.

Or not? \n\nHeck even on the issue of whether trans people should receive \u201cgender affirming care\u201d, she has said she will \u201cfollow the law\u201d. You would think as a Democrat, she\u2019d answer yes enthusiastically. Why be vague? \n\nWhat is her platform?

Heck even her door knockers harassing me at my home everyday don\u2019t seem to know.\n\nContrast that with our favorite fry cook Donald Trump: cutting taxes, finishing the wall,  stopping illegal immigration, ending wars, drill for more oil, and tariffing countries engaging in unfair trade practices. \n\nAnd you know what really shocked me? That this election cycle, Donald fucking Trump of all people is willing to admit that he made a mistake, and certainly more willing than Kamala and the Democrats. That\u2019s right, as big as his ego is, he admitted in his Joe Rogan interview that one of the mistakes he made in Washington was not always hiring the right people and not knowing how the Washington D.C. political system worked when he assumed the Presidency. And he wasn\u2019t even pressured to say those things.\n\nThe choice in this election is clear.

I went to see President Trump at MSG on Sunday. It was my first political rally/event of any kind. Here are some of my observations and take aways if you're interested so you dont have to rely on the media (sorry its long)!\n\nFirst and foremost WOW! Omgggg the turnout! I severely underestimated his level of support here. I figured i could leave an hour before and walk in to get a seat. No, lol. When I registered for tickets it said the event started at 7, I planned on leaving at 6. So at 445 when i see an article that trump takes the stage at 5, i jump off the couch and skeedaddle over. Luckily i live close to msg. I bought a cute hat and sweatshirt to wear. First time in my life ive worn anything remotely political, but i thought it was important to show that there are full on supporters and not just rally observers in nyc. Also a note that the crowd greatly filled in for a good 2 hours after me. I think the 7pm messaging kept a lot of ppl including me from coming earlier.\n\nI arrive at 515pm. Theres hundreds of cops as the streets outside msg are blocked off. An officer tells me they stopped letting ppl into msg a long time ago, but there are multiple sectioned off areas outside where we can watch on a screen. So i head to the closest area. Tulsi Gabbard is speaking (love her and her evolution \ud83e\udd0d). I join the crush of people and after an hour im able to scooch all the way up to the corner of 7th/fashion ave. Its PAKCED. You cant move, crammed in. People around me talked about getting in line 4, 5, 6 hours early and still not getting inside. Then i found out some people showed up the night before and camped out! \n\nHad it not been for the ppl in the crowd i would have just gone home. Bc the screen was blocked by a tree (multiple crowd chants to MOVE THAT TREE lol) and you could hardly hear a thing (except dana white\ud83d\ude06). Many ppl watching along on their phone for volume. But the vibe was unmatched. Hard to describe. So much enthusiasm. All creeds/colors. Everyone chatting and joking with the ppl around them. In front of me a boomer teamster chatting with a young arab kid draped in an American flag and his mom, and he joked with a gen z hispanic supporter on his other side the rest of the night. Multiply by 100. Everyone was just happy. It was a super communal atmosphere. Cheesy but true. Multiple comments about anger and outrage not being present here. Also the weather was really nice.\n\nFor the first half the crowd was about an even 50/50 split- half white half various shades of black and brown. DO NOT let anyone tell you minorities hate trump. Harris might take more of the overall minority vote than trump but i think we'll see the highest recorded numbers of minorities voting for trump than any other republican candidate in history. Same with the overall NYC and NY vote counts. Surprising to me were the insanely high numbers of orthodox and non orthodox jews. Even jewish people were talking about it. When i arrived id say at least, at least 20% of the crowd was outwardly jewish meaning identifiable dress or adornments, so the actual number was likely way higher. Also very surprising to me were the number of arab supporters. Saw palestine for trump signs. I didnt expect to see that. For the first time ever i saw a significant number of east asians in trump gear. Mostly men but a few women came with them. Also shocking the number of EASL chinese immigrants who showed up. All aged 50s+. Under represented were indian people. I saw a couple young guys in maga hats who looked like your average crypto bros. Saw 0 indian women. Also slightly underrepresented imo given the location...hispanics. Im told lots of hispanic supporters inside but outside the jewish supporters easily outnumbered hispanic by a large margin. At least where i was standing, but it didnt look different when i had to walk through the crowd to leave. To note the jewish orthodox supporters left early, many did not stay through the log jam of speakers, but I can confirm they were there early and in huge numbers. Black men showed up for trump, but I only saw 3 black women. The crowd was about 60-70% millennial/gen z aka under 40 with significant gen z representation. I saw 1 child. About a 60/40 split of men/women. I asked everyone around me where they were from. Was pleasantly surprised it was mostly the 5 boroughs. 2nd after that was LI. One guy came down from Boston.  I didnt meet anyone from NJ which I thought i would have.\n\nThere was only 1 agitator in the crowd. I think white guy with a small sign that simply said \"34 convictions\". He got a couples laughs and boos, but it was all very lighthearted and jokey. No one was aggressive, rude, or vulgar with him and he stayed longer than i did lol.\n\nI stayed for 3.5 hours. My phone died otherwise i probably would have stayed until trump finished speaking even though i couldnt hear him. Im really glad i got to experience a rally. I would absolutely go again, and I would go early to try and get a seat. Chatting with a couple other attendees we discussed how no other politician from any party could draw such a crowd and amount of enthusiasm like this in nyc. Not a single one. Love him or hate him, trump has the IT factor and ppl show up to witness it. \n\nLastly I'll end with snippets of my convos and those around me. Gave me a really interesting perspective on why people from such different backgrounds showed up and are voting for trump.\n\nMan, chinese, 50s-ish, EASL Queens- \n>biden voter but \"kamala is just too far left\". However hes greatly concerned about tariffs as tariffs \"raise prices\" and \"theyre very hard to remove once theyre in place\"\n\nGen z arab american LI- \n>\"i was always liberal until i did my own research. One of my friends is super liberal now every time i go over to her house shes mad at me\"\n\nJewish lady 50s Brooklyn- \n>appalled at bidens stance on gaza and also appalled at the abandonment of hurricane helene victims by the federal govt\n\nMany first time jewish trump voters discussing the obvious reason: \n>Gaza/anti semitism. And again i really need to drive home not only the presence of jewish voters but the ENTHUSIASM they had. Most around me were livestreaming their attendance. \n\nBlack gen z son and his black probably gen x father-\n>\"HELL YEA we love trump\"   \n\nTwo very young jewish girls behind me about 18-21ish Brooklyn (so young i had to explain to them who hulk hogan was lol)- \n>\"i just said i dont want to marry anyone super political and now here i am at a trump rally\" as they erupted in giggles\" \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc99\n\nWhite guy 50s queens- \n>\"we just want even tariffs\" also said \"why not give him a shot cant be worse than what we just had\"\n\nDiscussion between multiple gen z/millenial asian and hispanic men and 1 black man (bronx/manhattan/possibly other boroughs)-\n>about how no one voted for her and how you dont deserve to be the pres nominee on a ticket if youve never won a primary and how tulsi gabbard ended her last pres bid over marijuana.\n\nGen z hispanic kid Manhattan- \n>\"if she wins this country is cooked\"\n\n\nI know theres more but honestly im forgetting already bc it happened on sun. Oh and i was only heckled once. When i left i was waiting at the light to cross. This lady next to me was staring, i thought for a cab. Nope, at my hat. She was like YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. Then she went off about it isnt worth it, my life, my rights, hes a fascist, i cant believe it etc etc... I actually felt bad for her, she sincerely sounded distraught. I just told her things would be ok then kept moving. Honestly though, im not sure shes ok.\n\nEnjoy some pics and videos of my view and ps thats me in the TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING hat. Covered my face tho bc reddit is unhinged lmao \ud83d\udc80\n\nGuys, if im lying im dying! If you get the opportunity to attend a rally, i highly suggest it. It was fun, positive, and i left feeling really hopeful \u2764\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf2 \n\nVideos linked here bc reddit wont let me upload them:\n\n[WE WANT TRUMP!](https://vimeo.com/1024446361?share=copy)\n\n[Our president finally takes the stage!](https://vimeo.com/1024443515?share=copy)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gf063g"}

I am proud of what we accomplished then and I have dedicated my life to the pursuit of an enduring human presence in space \u2013 it is a calling that runs through every fiber of my being.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nOver time, I have seen our government\u2019s approach to space wax and wane. But under the first Trump Administration, I was impressed to see how human space exploration was elevated as a policy of high importance again. Under President Trump\u2019s first term, America saw a revitalized interest in Space, and his Administration reignited national efforts to get back to the Moon, and push on to Mars. The Trump Administration also reinstituted the National Space Council, and our Nation\u2019s defense was enhanced with the creation of the U.S. Space Force \u2013 increasingly important as space becomes a contested domain. At the same time, I have been enthused and excited by the great advancements in the private sector space economy, led by visionaries like @elonmusk.\u00a0 These are concrete accomplishments that align with my concerns and America\u2019s policy priorities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAmerica is facing serious and difficult challenges both at home and abroad.\u00a0 The Presidency requires clarity in judgement, decisiveness, and calm under pressure that few have a natural ability to manage, or the life experience to successfully undertake. It is a job where decisions are made that routinely involve American lives \u2013 some urgently but not without thought. The job requires sober analysis of frightening scenarios, and the instinct to lead with resolve. From the skies over Korea in air-to-air combat to navigating, landing, and walking on the Moon, I appreciate this kind of pressure. I know what it is like to have to make these kinds of decisions, with firmness and follow-through.\n\u00a0\nIn this election, we have a choice and we all have one vote. For some, the choice may not be easy \u2013 but in times of uncertainty real leaders are most needed \u2013 to guide and inspire a people, to push through the noise, recognize what really matters, and accomplish missions critical to all citizens. Most Americans rightly consider it an honor to cast their vote for a leader they believe will best serve the nation. For me, for the future of our country, to meet enormous challenges, and for the proven policy accomplishments above, I believe we are best served by voting for @realDonaldTrump. I wholeheartedly endorse him for President of the United States.

I was seeing that we were winning early voting in Nevada and New Jersey, I've also seen polls saying AZ is for Trump and that Harris canceled her ads in North Carolina, and that PA extended early voting because of how many people wanted to vote. I am a first time voter so I'm not an expert in this stuff. Is is true that we're winning early voting? I'm not seeing the \"mainstream media\" reporting on any of this.I've seen Trump making plays on VA, NM, NJ, and NH. Do we really think he can win at least a couple of those states? I think VA could be in play. But would love to hear everyone's thoughts on early voting. \n\nAnd here's a message from me. I've been a member of this sub for a long time but this is my first major election voting. I've supported Trump for years and I'm so happy to be voting for him. There's no one else like him and he's changed the party for the better. He is someone who truly cares about the nation and its people. He's not perfect, he has flaws but that's what makes him just like us.  A Kamala presidency makes me nervous, whether its being able to live an affordable future and live the American dream, or her dragging us into a war. Conservatives have been treated like garbage for years. I've even had teachers try and make me feel ashamed for being a white, Christian, conservative, Country boy. I believe that the golden years are ahead for this country. We are in for some very good years if Trump wins. If Kamala wins, she's only going to fuel the conservative comeback even more. I'm a religious man, but no matter who ends up as President: Jesus is still king.

People are now able to get their information quicker because it can be easily condensed.

For example, the Joe Rogan-Trump podcast generated approximately ten million views in a matter of eight hours after its release. In this age, content creators can collaborate with important and powerful figures easier than they would have in the past (I sometimes call it the \"Age of Influencers\" because there are so many people now who want to \"impact\" others, whether it's actually for the better or for the worse).\n\nDo you believe people are starting to turn away from mainstream media or is it so powerful that it can't go away? And what impact do you believe mainstream media will likely have on future generations (assuming it will/will not continue to dominate the political landscape)?

I\u2019m pretty new here\u2014I am a recent CSE grad and have been compiling a huge project to try to create an accurate election model. I\u2019ve worked with tons of data this cycle. I just wanted to say that there\u2019s been a lot of dramatics around polling. There are three main points I\u2019d like to make to quell some panic \n\n1. Outlier polls are released to preserve the image of integrity from a pollster. If we\u2019re talking about that Iowa poll, our intuition shows it\u2019s almost certainly incorrect, so why publish it? It\u2019s because it shows that pollsters are willing to publish data even though they think it\u2019s ridiculous. A outlier poll one in a while is even sometimes \u201cgood\u201d for a pollsters reputation.  \n\n2. EV data for Dems is not great. That\u2019s a fact, and Dems will admit that. But this means it\u2019s more than essential to drive turnout to this election. \n\n3. State polling or National polling will be correct this cycle. Neither are congruent. Either there is a huge underlying demographic change, or this is true. \n\n4. Relax and vote. There are pollsters that almost always tilt results. Polling is a psychological phenomenon too, \u201cherding\u201d almost always occurs because small/med pollsters try to preserve their reputation no matter the results. Nate silver pointed this out. Although I think his model is actually very silly sometimes, he makes an excellent point with this. \n\n5. Trumps internals apparently look good. Even so in Virginia. I\u2019ll take Trump being oddly calm as a good sign. \n\n6. Relax. Idiotic doomers on social media are driving this (chronically online) conversation. Right wing influencers are acting like Democratic operatives and it\u2019s kinda weird tbh. Don\u2019t doom. Please. \n\n7. Relax. Trumps odds are great this cycle. I\u2019ve calculated it myself. \n\n9. Drag people to the polls.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1giczkj/a_note_on_polls_from_a_data_perspective/"}

", "body": "The Trump derangement syndrome was truly real with me in 2016- I spent the entire day after the election in bed, hungover and crying. I thought our country was over, I was terrified for the safety of my Jewish husband, and I was telling my gay friends to get married in case their marriage rights were stripped during Trump\u2019s administration. \n\nBut in 2020 I started to rethink things. Me and 8 million other New Yorkers were confined to our tiny apartments indefinitely. We had cops driving cars through our parks, telling people to sit 6 feet away from each other, while my peers praised their \u201cDaddy Cuomo\u201d for doing what they viewed Trump wasn\u2019t willing to do. I watched protestors tear up our city- many of the same people who professed their loved for \u201cDaddy Cuomo\u201d- saying the actions of the protestors were just because the existential threat of systemic racism was far greater than the risk of Covid. I watched those same people dance in the streets when Biden won the election. Meanwhile, I had been laid off twice at that point in 2020 because of crowd restrictions in public places, and was another month away from being laid off for a third time because of the spike of Covid cases in December of 2020. \n\nSince Biden has been elected and since his first magic trick of giving us all $1200 and then devaluing all our money by 2-3%, life here in NYC has steadily declined. I know people assaulted in the streets and on the subway. Our mayor has indicted for corruption. I grocery shop at Walmart in NJ because even the lowest quality foods in the city are ridiculously expensive. It\u2019s $20 for a cocktail around here these days. A friend of mine who opened a business here  18 months ago expected to spend $200k to flip the space, build inventory, and hire staff ended up spending $1m instead because of inflation. Meanwhile we have immigrants who came here because they wanted over the last 4 years living in Midtown Manhattan hotels- where any average New Yorker would have to pay $4-6k a month, having their groceries paid for or complaining when their free food isn\u2019t good enough. We have children who are graduating high school without basic reading and mathematical skills despite our school district spending $21,000 on every student per year. \n\nMeanwhile we are being told constantly by left leaning media that the economy has never been better. We were told Biden was sprightly and ready for four more years even though we could all see with our eyes he was deteriorating. Kamala was heavily disliked amongst my fellow liberals on July 20th but was now the hero everyone was asking for on July 21st. Now as she\u2019s campaigning she\u2019s telling people we can\u2019t have four more years of this and my colleagues nod and yassify her- even though we all know the last four years WERE HER. How am I the only person amongst the Democrats I know who sees this? \n\nEnough is enough of the gaslighting by the legacy media and I\u2019m fed up with being told to not trust my own eyes. I\u2019m sick of being told by celebrities who to vote for, while they released that insipid \u201cImagine\u201d video they made during 2020 from the comfort of their Malibu estates while I and many others were on the phone with unemployment for hours, making sure we could get money so we didn\u2019t lose our homes during a global pandemic.   I hope that many other liberals this year will see how we\u2019ve been played and will attempt to stop the cycle, like me. \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1gj4691/im_an_nyc_democrat_and_i_voted_for_trump_today/"}

Joe Biden won the election in 2020 under dubious circumstances at best, during one of the most tumultuous periods in American history. Since he took office, the cost of living has soared, the border has become a sieve, crime is through the roof, he thoroughly embarrassed the country with his disastrous withdrawal in Afghanistan, he's playing footsie with terrorist sponsor states at the expense of a loyal ally, and he basically gave Putin the green light to invade Ukraine.\n\nBiden's track record was bad enough, but his mental decline made his bid for re-election untenable. After the debate with Trump back in June, it became clear that Biden was not competent to run the country *now,* much less for another four years. Under normal circumstances, Democrats would have to just swallow the fact that they backed the wrong horse, accept defeat in this election, and gear up for a new election cycle in 2028. But they just couldn't allow that to happen - Trump is such a \"threat to democracy\" that they had to bend the rules of the electoral process into a pretzel and install a woman who had never won a single primary, earned a single delegate, or even had a single primary vote cast in her direction, bypassing any vetting process, just to make sure that Trump couldn't run unopposed.\n\nThe media has been covering for Kamala Harris ever since \"Joe\" tweeted his announcement that he would step out of the race. (He wouldn't resign the presidency, nor would Kamala invoke the 25th Amendment, because they don't want her to be held responsible for anything that's happened the past four years. Convenient, isn't it?) Kamala has been bouncing from one softball public appearance to the next, and even despite her clear inability to deliver concise policy proposals and her penchant for talking in circles, she still has the Democratic masses falling in line to vote for her.\n\nTrump *has to* win tomorrow. If he doesn't, and Kamala wins, the left will have successfully reached critical mass in this country.\n\nIt will mean that a vapid, vacuous, empty husk of a woman will have successfully failed her way upward to the presidency. It will be proof positive that no Democrat would ever need to have a coherent political platform, because the Democrat base will just Vote Blue No Matter Who, as they've instructed themselves to do since the last presidential election.\n\nIt will mean that the media has so fundamentally brainwashed the population that despite the increasingly splintered way in which news is disseminated, people still default to the New York Times, CNN, and all the other legacy news outlets as the standard bearers of the truth, no matter how slanted they present that truth.\n\nIt will mean that any counterarguments to the left's platform will be immediately taken down by tech oligarchs as \"misinformation\", because anything that challenges their worldview must be wrong and thus must not be seen by the public at large.\n\nIt will mean that the public's muscle memory has become so hard-wired to vote for Democrats, no matter how bad the candidate, no matter how expensive groceries are, no matter how much the rest of the world is in flames due to their dithering, just because they will always be convinced that the other guy, be it Trump, Vance, Desantis, Vivek, or anyone else, is the next \"threat to democracy\" whose \"extreme\" views disqualify them from consideration.\n\nIt will mean that even if somehow Democrats fumble the ball hard enough that voting for a Republican seems like a viable option, they will be able to change the rules in the middle of the game to tilt the odds back in their favor. It will mean that the machinery they have entrenched across the country to thwart electoral threats to their hegemony are robust enough to manufacture a win, no matter how legitimate it appears, and that no challenges to that legitimacy will be able to stop them.\n\nA lot of people think that a Kamala Harris win, combined with Democratic control of the House and Senate, means that the filibuster will be eliminated, Puerto Rico and DC will become states, the Supreme Court will be packed, and the Justice Department will be weaponized to throw any legitimate opposition to their rule in jail. They may do some, all, or none of this. The point is they won't have to. If a candidate *this bad* and *this dishonest* can win an election when the country is in *this much* disarray, there is no set of circumstances where a Republican is ever going to successfully oust them.\n\nI posted on Facebook after the 2020 election that the left had achieved critical mass. (Facebook, of course, took down the post within 60 seconds of me submitting it.) This election will determine whether or not that hypothesis actually comes true. If Republicans don't win tomorrow, they're never winning again.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1gjm5h5/2024_is_a_critical_mass_election/"}

Most of the organizations that give Harris the edge in the Electoral College also give Harris an edge in North Carolina. The NY Times has her winning by 2%. CNN has her winning by 1%. The RCP average has Trump winning by 1.5%.\n\n**If President Trump outperforms the polls, then look for the rest of the states to follow a similar shift for Trump.**\n\nFor instance, if Trump wins North Carolina by 2%, then the NY Times-Siena results were off by 4%. That would bode well for Trump in the other states where the New York Times has Harris up by a slim margin. It can mean that key demographic turnout within their their pool selection of \"likely voters\" was incorrect.\n\n**It will certainly come down to turnout.
