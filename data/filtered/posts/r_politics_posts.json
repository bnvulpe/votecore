AMA!", "body": "Hi r/politics!\n\nMy name is Maura Keller, and I am the Democratic nominee for Georgia\u2019s 3rd Congressional District.\n\nI am a retired Lieutenant Colonel, serving in the U.S. Army for 26 years after enlisting as an MP at 17. I have also worked as a strategic analyst, taking contracts dealing with the Office of the Chief Army Reserve and the Under Secretary of the Department of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. Most recently, I have worked as a Nuclear Medicine Technologist, spending my last 3 years at the Atlanta VA.\n\nMy experiences as a health care worker for our veterans, combined with the fall of Roe v. Wade, was enough for me to quit my job and run for Congress. In Georgia, we desperately need VA reform. After working in the VA health system and seeing firsthand how we mistreat our service members, I know how to make positive changes that prioritize their care. As I like to say: I know where the bodies are buried. We also need immediate protections for reproductive healthcare, a raise in the minimum wage, and so much more.\n\nYes, I\u2019m running in a red district. But, for the first time ever, we actually have a shot at flipping this seat. [I'm up against Trump loyalist and MAGA sweetheart Brian Jack](https://youtu.be/LpkrRz2y6bs). The historical data for this district has gone out of the window. For the first time in years, we have an open seat. Reproductive freedom is on the ballot. We have a large number of Republicans who don't want to support MAGA candidates. It\u2019s time for us all to take a stand in District 3, and all of you can help by spreading this AMA. \n\nSome of you might think that a woman running on reproductive healthcare in a +37 Trump district that has never elected a woman is a fool's errand. I say we only need to look at Alabama, Ohio, and Kentucky to know the power of running on common sense reproductive healthcare. If you\u2019d like to stay in touch, please join my subreddit r/maurakeller. If you\u2019d like to donate to my campaign, that would be a huge help for us in flipping this seat.\n\nOkay, r/politics.

I grew up in WNY, raised by a single mother who struggled to raise four kids. I attended SUNY Brockport and later graduated from Syracuse Law School while supporting myself as a painter and carpenter.\n\n\nAfter law school, I moved to Washington, D.C., where I became a First Amendment public interest attorney. I crafted bipartisan legislation, testified before the House and Senate, and successfully sued to shut down anti-consumer practices in the telecommunications industry. I eventually returned home to help run my mother's startup, a home care agency serving elderly and disabled people. In recent years, I've served in local offices and taken on staffing roles in other congressional campaigns.\n\n\nToday, Congress is broken, and so are many of its members. Common sense, hard work, and actual results have been replaced by finger-pointing and insults. You don't need to be an extremist, ultra-partisan, or a conspiracy theorist to be effective in government.\n\nUnfortunately, too many politicians enter office wealthy and leave even richer. It's time to remove the influence of money from our governing process. No more stock trading, corporate PACs, or the Congress-to-Lobbyist pipeline. We need term limits and a renewed focus on public service. I believe in leading by example\u2014I haven't accepted any Corporate PAC or PAC money, and I won't. I will not trade stocks or securities and return home after serving two terms.\n\n\nOur district is not wealthy. Unlike our current Representative, I know working families and young people can't bear the burden of further tax cuts for billionaires and large corporations. I will work alongside leaders like Senator Casey to combat corporate greed, hold Big Oil and other large corporations accountable for price fixing, and provoke action on the root causes of inflation.\n\n\nNY-24 is plagued by a significant number of cancer clusters. No surprise, given the numerous Superfund sites, toxic waste dumps, and towering landfills shipped into our towns and villages from NYC and New England. We have poisons and forever chemicals leaching into the vast lakes we use for drinking water, the farmland where we grow our crops, and the air we breathe. I am deeply concerned about how this will deteriorate our struggling ecosystems and, inevitably, the health of my neighbors. From day one, my staff and I will tackle this emergency, which is threatening our national and economic security. \n\n\nAs I've said, we are made up of many rural communities. Like other similar places across the country, it's filled with hardworking people whose eagerness for pragmatic, common-sense reform is often understated. I am a moderate populist, and our team is on the ground every day. What we found:  Independents, Democrats, and Republicans all know that we can no longer avoid reaching across aisles and work towards urgently needed changes right here at home in the 24th District. \n\n\nIn contrast, our current Representative, Claudia Tenney, focuses her tenure on moral panics, crafting every appearance on cable news around a mission of attracting headlines that please her big-money donors (she endorses President Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize) and undermine our Democratic systems. She is disconnected from our community and sees us only as a means to power.\n\n\n\n[Website](https://www.daveforupstate.com/) | [Twitter](https://x.com/DaveforUpstate) | [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/daveforupstate) | [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/daveforupstate/)\n\n[Volunteer With Us](https://www.daveforupstate.com/get-involved)  | [Donate](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/david-wagenhauser-for-upstate-ny-2) | [Register to Vote](https://voterreg.dmv.ny.gov/MotorVoter/)\n\nContact me directly!\n\u2709\ufe0f Dave@daveforupstate.com\n\n[Proof](https://imgur.com/a/qifSt7C)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1es194a/im_david_wagenhauser_democratic_candidate_for_new/"}

The volume is turned up in states with abortion measures on the ballot.  \n\nCeline Castronuovo has been covering the political and legal fights to get abortion-related measures on the 2024 ballot in 10 states\u2013Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, and South Dakota. \n\nSeven states have voted to protect abortion access since the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, and abortion rights advocates are hoping to build on their winning streak. But Republicans and anti-abortion groups aren\u2019t backing down, running opposition campaigns and encouraging voters to reject measures they claim will allow for unregulated abortions throughout pregnancy.\n\nCeline will be traveling to Florida later this month to report on some of the grassroots campaigning around the ballot measure there. She also covers legislation and litigation related to reproductive health, gender-affirming care, prescription drug costs, and more. \n\nMaeve Sheehey reports on Capitol Hill, where the Senate\u2019s Democratic majority recently voted on a number of bills related to abortion and IVF access. Maeve will hit the road this month to cover abortion in Nebraska, where races will play out that are critical to majority control in the House and Senate. Meanwhile, she\u2019ll keep her eye on next year to see how the 119th Congress could impact access to abortion. \n\nSo, what would these states\u2019 abortion-related ballot measures do? How are voters responding to abortion messaging in swing districts?
