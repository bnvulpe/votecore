The reason: the money never came. “That began the demise of the Edward J. Friel Company… which has been around since my grandfather,” he said.\n\n> Donald Trump often portrays himself as a savior of the working class who will "protect your job." But a USA TODAY NETWORK analysis found he has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades — and a large number of those involve ordinary Americans, like the Friels, who say Trump or his companies have refused to pay them.\n\n> Trump’s companies have also been cited for 24 violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act since 2005 for failing to pay overtime or minimum wage, according to U.S. Department of Labor data. That includes 21 citations against the defunct Trump Plaza in Atlantic City and three against the also out-of-business Trump Mortgage LLC in New York. Both cases were resolved by the companies agreeing to pay back wages.\n\n> In addition to the lawsuits, the review found more than 200 mechanic’s liens — filed by contractors and employees against Trump, his companies or his properties claiming they were owed money for their work — since the 1980s. The liens range from a $75,000 claim by a Plainview, N.Y., air conditioning and heating company to a $1 million claim from the president of a New York City real estate banking firm. On just one project, Trump’s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, records released by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in 1990 show that at least 253 subcontractors weren’t paid in full or on time, including workers who installed walls, chandeliers and plumbing.\n\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/09/donald-trump-unpaid-bills-republican-president-laswuits/85297274/\n\n> But for the carpenters, electricians, plumbers, window installers and other contractors who built Trump’s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City three decades ago, the wounds from not being paid still fester.\n\n> Triad Building Specialties ended up taking out a $40,000 loan just to pay its suppliers. And then the firm needed another decade just to pay off the loan. In the end, Triad received only 40 cents on the dollar from Trump for its work on the Taj, said Jenkins, now 49 and the firm’s co-owner.\n\n...\n\n> When contractors complained about delays in pay, Trump said he needed to complete audits to make sure they weren’t overcharging. Years later, when he ran for president and was asked about his failure to pay, Trump suggested that he needed to carefully check the bills because he feared that some contractors were cheating him.\n\n> By 1991, when the Taj collapsed into bankruptcy, Trump offered those contractors only 33 cents in cash for each dollar he owed. He promised another 50 cents on the dollar later. But many contractors say it took years to get anything.\n\n> And they were the lucky ones.\n\nhttps://www.northjersey.com/story/news/columnists/mike-kelly/2020/01/24/donald-trump-still-owes-money-to-contractors-who-built-taj-mahal-atlantic-city/4547037002/\n\n>After putting in long hours for a special event at Trump National Doral, a Miami resort, 48 servers had to sue for unpaid overtime. The settlements averaged around $800 per worker, but went as high as $3,000 in one case. On top of that, a paint shop owner named Juan Carlos Enriquez also sued Trump\'s business, claiming he never got the final payment for a paint shipment to the same resort. In 2017, after a three-year legal fight, a court found in Enriquez\'s favor, and ordered Trump\'s company to pay the final $32,000, plus $300,000 in legal fees.\n\nhttps://theweek.com/articles/783976/brief-history-trumps-smalltime-swindles'}

The North, “invigorated by constant struggle with nature, had become materialistic, grasping for wealth and power.” The South had a “more generous climate” which had led to a finer society based upon “veracity and honor in man, chastity and fidelity in women.” Like tragic heroes, Southerners had waged a noble but doomed struggle to preserve their superior civilization.

Roughly 70% of those who were dropped lost their coverage because of procedural reasons such as paperwork issues, although some may no longer qualify for other reasons, such as an increase in income.\n\nDropped with little notice\nMelissa Mazaeda, vice president of care coordinator J&M Support Coordination in Florida, says procedural mishaps have been particularly problematic for people with developmental disabilities, who often require extra assistance to complete the renewal process. Advocates for the disabled say far too many were lumped into the wrong Medicaid categories, were dropped with little notice and didn’t receive timely help when they were disenrolled.\n\nMazaeda said states should never have kicked the developmentally disabled off Medicaid in the first place. \n\n“They are never going to not need Medicaid. You don’t get over Down syndrome. There is no cure for cerebral palsy. You don’t get better from spina bifida or autism,’” Mazaeda said. “They’re going to require lifelong services. And the basis of that is Medicaid.” \n\nThe National Health Law program — a nonprofit that advocates for the health rights of low-income and underserved individuals — has filed civil rights complaints in Colorado, Texas and Washington, D.C., alleging discrimination against people with disabilities.\n\nIn Florida, a class action lawsuit accuses the state’s unwinding process of being not just sloppy, but illegal. Plaintiffs allege the state violated the constitutional rights of tens of thousands of Floridians, ending coverage “without adequate notice” and with “little or no explanation of the actual reason.”\n\nOf the 1.9 million people in Florida who lost Medicaid coverage, according to KFF, patient advocates estimate that thousands of disabled people like Eakin have been affected.'}
