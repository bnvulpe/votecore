CNN Senior Legal Analyst Describes How The Trump Conviction Was A Political Hit Job  
  
1. ""The judge donated money... in plain violation of a rule prohibiting New York judges from making political donations—to a pro-Biden, anti-Trump political operation.""  
  
2. Alvin Bragg boasted on the campaign trail in an overwhelmingly Democrat county, “It is a fact that I have sued Trump over 100 times.”  
  
3. ""Most importantly, the DA’s charges against Trump push the outer boundaries of the law and due process.""  
  
4. ""The charges against Trump are obscure, and nearly entirely unprecedented. In fact, no state prosecutor — in New York, or Wyoming, or anywhere — has ever charged federal election laws as a direct or predicate state crime, against anyone, for anything. None. Ever.""  
  
5. The DA inflated misdemeanors past the statute of limitations and ""electroshocked them back to life"" by alleging the falsification of business records was committed 'with intent to commit another crime.'  
  
6. ""Inexcusably, the DA refused to specify what those unlawful means actually were — and the judge declined to force them to pony up — until right before closing arguments. So much for the constitutional obligation to provide notice to the defendant of the accusations against him in advance of trial.""  
  
7. ""In these key respects, the charges against Trump aren’t just unusual. They’re bespoke, seemingly crafted individually for the former president and nobody else.""  
  
8. ""The Manhattan DA’s employees reportedly have called this the “Zombie Case” because of various legal infirmities, including its bizarre charging mechanism. But it’s better characterized as the Frankenstein Case, cobbled together with ill-fitting parts into an ugly, awkward, but more-or-less functioning contraption that just might ultimately turn on its creator.""

You may recall that Senator Tuberville previously blocked all nominations for an extended period of time, because the military was violating the Hyde Amendment by facilitating abortions. Basically, the Committee comes to a complete stand still as soon as one member demands individual interviews of each candidate, instead of agreeing to just rubber stamp the Biden list of recommendations. Tuberville held out around 8 months last time from what I recall. At this point, I think that Biden is done appointing federal judges.

The other steps listed will depend on how many GOP members of the House and Senate that they can convince to join. The initial letter had 8 Senators. Other GOP members have been joining enthusiastically since then, but I am waiting for someone to compile a comprehensive list. At a minimum, it appears that Biden or the democrats' odds of passing further legislation are quite challenging.

Interestingly, they also intend to cut off future funds to the Biden White House, stopping the already many many millions of taxpayer dollars they have spent on lawfare against Trump. Most of this was paid to big private law firms to assist the prosecutors. Judge Cannon recently released a treasure trove of discovery proving the White House's extreme involvement in that case, including paying outside law firms to assist. Now the GOP is vowing to stop it, with quite likely tens of millions in outstanding legal fees, that Biden will have to pull from other pet projects to pay.

Or that anyone they HIRED to do a job they cannot do for themselves hasn’t made a mistake?""","[

  
What even the Left is failing to fully grasp about this sham conviction is the seismic shift this means for everyone, politicians and business executives particularly.  
  
It is NOT ALWAYS about TRUMP.  
  
This was a watershed event.  
  
\*\*\*\*Take this from a person who really wanted another candidate but, in good conscience, I refuse to be silent.  
  
In ONE trial, the Left dismantled The Bill of Rights and the Constitution.  
  
Can any adult over a certain age claim they’ve NEVER done anything wrong or made a mistake?   
  
Or that anyone they HIRED to do a job they cannot do for themselves hasn’t made a mistake?  
  
Can anyone claim they or a professional they hired have not done something perfectly legal that, if the occasion arises, an enemy couldn’t go back through a legal code so long no one fully knows what’s in it and cobble together a way to present what should have been legal as ILLEGAL?  
  
Trump paid an ATTORNEY and a licensed ACCOUNT/BOOK KEEPER to log what were then completely legitimate expenses.  
  
Even Stormy Daniels is on camera on the Bill Maher show laughing and saying Trump was nothing close to a “Me Too.” Etc.  
  
We have vast evidence this was a shakedown. It happens.   
  
Hush money until recently was par for the course (Eg. Bill Clinton paid Paula Jones $850,000 in the 90s compared to $130,000 to Stormy). NDAs are so common I’d be shocked if most people hadn’t signed one.  
  
Fast forward.  
  
Our Founding Fathers were very worried about enforcing laws ex post facto (after the fact).  
  
They also placed great emphasis on protecting property because they came from countries where, if you spoke up, the government would just take everything.  
  
Now we look at Trump.   
  
His political opponents took a misdemeanor that no court or lawyer would touch for almost a decade because it was a Nothing Burger.   
  
What little was there had passed the statute of limitations.  
  
What did they do?   
  
They resurrected essentially a bookkeeping charge as a felony, then tried an alleged federal crime in a biased STATE court, and made sure Trump was NOT in a court of his peers (that pesky Bill of Rights).  
  
This would be like charging Nancy Pelosi in a deep red West Texas courtroom then claiming she was judged by her peers.  
  
\*\*\*This has by and large been why America has held to the custom of not going after former Presidents criminally. It’s literally impossible to get an unbiased jury.  
  
We know this is bullshit. They know it’s bullshit.  
  
Problem is…it’s radioactive bullshit that just punched a trillion unseen holes in ALL our freedoms    
  
Then the civil fraud case in NY where Trump lost and was ordered to pay a gazillion dollars in damages when there were no victims and even Deutsche Bank was repaid. CNN legal experts said this was a bad move.  
  
Constitutional violation.  
  
What does this mean? For you? For me? For America?  
  
American law is based off English Common Law, which is why one must ALWAYS be very careful about what precedents any case sets b/c once one sets a PRECEDENT it’s almost impossible to put the genie back in the bottle.  
  
Now?  
  
Political opponents or any business person (or regular citizen) who refuses to comply with whoever has the biggest stick?  
  
The message is clear.   
  
It’s open season. They’ll take all you have and JAIL you if you dare stand in the way.  
  
Who will want to run for office? Who would dare build a business in America? If you cross the wrong agenda and THIS can be done to you?  
  
And parties shift. Sure my generation and those close to my age respect the rule of law and believe in what America was and is supposed to be.  
  
But it’s pretty common knowledge that the successive generations push the boundaries much farther.  
  
Look at the college campuses. NOW, look at what the Left just handed to a generation of very angry, very entitled young people who have no respect for the rule of law.

When you drill it down, what is Trump Derangement Syndrome really all about?  It is a mass psychological phenomenon like the world has never seen.

Tump inspires a level of hysterical RAGE and HATE from the left that is completely unhinged and  illogical. Biden could raise their taxes to 98%, burn down their cities, and force them to take a new vaccine every week… 

And they would stilll be screaming on Reddit about ‘anything is better than Trump! He is the reincarnation of Hitler, he wants to nuke the world!’ 

We already know the media, academia, and social media has been pounding anti-Trump bullshit into their brains 24/7 for years. It still doesn’t explain the sheer level of insane hate. 

I have a theory that Trump’s 2016 election was so shocking, and he behaved so differently from what they expect from a presidential candidate, that it deeply traumatized people on the left. 

The fact that he is a swaggering Alpha Male with a hot wife added fuel to the fire and reminded them of how they’d been bullied as kids…

I've worked at the country's oldest free market think tank, the American Enterprise Institute, as a visiting fellow. My colleagues included Charles Murray, John Bolton, Jonah Goldberg, Lynn Cheney, and Paul Wolfowitz among others. My immediate supervisor, Kevin Hassett, led the Trump Council of Economic Advisors and close colleagues served on the Trump transition team charged with analyzing the FCC, where I worked as a technical advisor appointed by Chairman Pai.

It's my opinion that the modern conservative movement was started by Bill Buckley and Irving Kristol and that it overlaps with neo-conservatism to such a degree that they're indistinguishable. Its principles come to down to respect for the constitution and the rule of law, individual responsibility, fiscal responsibility, free markets and free trade, and strong national defense. It's an ideology based on an intellectual analysis of the best ways to spread peace and prosperity.

  
In the US today we have a number of prominent politicians who claim to be conservative simply because they're broadly pro-Republican and anti-Democrat. That's a good start, but it doesn't go very far. I think Republicans have strayed pretty far from the movement's ideals.

2. Unlike most challengers, you have a record of your own in office.  Remind everyone of what they were paying for gas and milk when you were in charge.  This is an economy election.

3.  While you do want to remind voters of what they liked about your term, you don't want to remind them of what they didn't like.  Don't yell.  Don't interrupt excessively.  Your supporters all know that you are a fighter.  The swing voters want to see you act like a president.  You probably lost the election with the disastrous ""yell at the old man"" debate in 2020.  Don't repeat it.

4.  The moderators, Biden, or (most likely) all of them are going to hammer the NY conviction.  Feel free to talk about it being a political hit job.  Don't claim innocence.  Everyone knows you paid Stormy off.  Most people don't care.  You an also bring up that Biden's special prosecutor didn't recommend charges against him because he's too old and diminished to stand trial.

5. Everyone who thinks the 2020 election was stolen is already going to vote for you.  There is no need to even mention it.  If you are asked, just say you are focused on winning this year.  The only reminders people want from your first term are the good things.  

6.  Feel free to bring up Biden's diminished mental capacity.  But do it in a way that makes it sound like you feel sorry for him.  He will get mad.  Let him start yelling.  The voters already wonder if he is still in control.   Let them see that he's not.  As soon as a presidential candidate has to argue that he didn't poop his pants during a D-Day memorial, he's lost the election.

7.  But don't count on Biden looking like a dementia ward patient during the debate.  He will be hopped up on all the stimulants the pharmaceutical industry has to offer.  But a ""Why did Barack Obama have to lead you off the stage by your hand?"" question doesn't have a good answer even if delivered semi-cogently.

8.  The moderators will try their best to hurt you and help Biden.  Do their job for them.  Ask him questions.  He's not smart enough to avoid trying to answer them.

","If the republican party really wants to make strides in capturing millennial votes, they have got to start having clear solutions and policy positions on some of the financial hardships younger generations are facing. Trump dodged important questions last night that I wanted to see an answer to. Child care and a plan for social security. As someone with multiple kids in daycare, the costs have rocketed. In the past 5 years, infant care at my daycare has gone from $275 a week in 2019 to over $400 in 2024. 

Child care is not affordable at all for the median salaried worker and many families elect to keep a parent home instead to watch the kids. The child care tax credit was a significant benefit to families when it was implemented and should not be thrown away because it came from the other side. If Republicans want to see more families having kids and less abortions, ease the financial barriers of having kids. 

Social Security is a looming problem. The math isn't good and something will have to change if social security is to be continued. Either take a position that it's going to be phased out and replaced by something else or have an answer to how they will keep it funded. Just pointing out that you're going to make the economy better and fix immigration doesn't solve the issue. 

Housing has also become out of reach. Come up with a plan to stabilize the market so that people can get there again. Ban foreign investment in real estate. Stop private equity groups from buying all the starter homes up and flipping them for double the price. At the very least acknowledge that it's a huge problem for younger generations.

This could not be further from the truth.

In recent years the elite Left has grown increasingly arrogant and hyper-partisan, and therefore sloppy. They take their support among their usual constituents for granted. They assumed that they could coalesce enough distrust around Trump, with their technicality trials and usual Charlottesville-style lies, that it literally would not matter who or what was in the Oval Office. 

The debate last night was a complete and utter meltdown. Echo chambers and willful ignorance can only hold back the truth for so long. Last night millions of Americans and others around the world saw firsthand the mental decay of the most powerful man in their world. It was a spectacular embarrassment not only for Joe and Jill, but also for the entire left-of-center media complex that has been telling the US public for almost 4 years that Biden is fine, sharp, and ready to keep serving. 

Joe Biden may be well on his way to dementia but the Big Guy, above all his other loathsome qualities,has a complete and total lust for power. He would have to willingly give up the presidency, something he has coveted his entire self-serving political career.Even if they can somehow pry the delegates away from him, it is very far from certain who would fill the void. 

There is no uniform ""they"" in charge - the Left is made up of many conflicting fragments, ranging from Big Labor to the Climate Lobby. The chaos that would ensue from trying to replace Biden will be just as damaging as keeping him around. Kamala Harris will not go quietly. Governor Newsome smells blood in the water.

a.      His debate was terrible and this is after one week being completely sequestered at Camp David.

b.      He has no understanding of the topics discussed

c.      He has a serious problem keeping focus of the topics while talking

d.      He has been completely careless in trying to understand the topics, and his last 3.5 years reflect poor execution

e.      He should stand trial and be charged regarding his failure to control classified information (DoJ’s assessment would be incorrect in asserting his memory and age).  He should also stand trial and be charged for possible quid pro quo for Ukraine dealings.

 

2.      Biden is NOT competent

a.      He has a medical condition effectively disqualifying him.

b.      There has been a cover-up of sorts by people in very high positions of influence

c.      He has not been executing his office of the Presidency

i.     Who has been acting as the President and acting with decision-making authority?  This should be made known to the People. 

d.      He should no longer be President IMMEDIATELY.  He needs to formally resign or they need to execute the provisions in the 25^(th) Amendment.

i.     If we are saying he is unfit to run no longer, then he is unfit RIGHT NOW for the office (which is one of the hardest jobs in the world).  He still has half of a year of service left, to which there are major economic stakes and things in the world occurring.  Also, there is a known threat to national security if the Executive function is left unfulfilled.

e.      Him being propped up as President by family, aides, etc. is tantamount to elder abuse.

i.     They should be investigated immediately and it should be uncovered as to when this condition started.

f.       VP Kamala Harris should be sworn in immediately as POTUS.

Xi is posturing to invade Taiwan because he knows Biden won't stop him. Hamas got the green light from Iran to invade Israel because they knew the US would not be able to competently support Israel.

Conservative,t3_1dqqibt,2024-06-28 20:22:49,5,0.7300000190734861,Highlights of yesterday's debate,"-- Joe Biden looked absolutely senile, flustered, and weak. Finally, Joe Biden was forced into a public situation where he was forced to demonstrate competence. Dems have been denying and excusing the hundreds, maybe thousands, of videos of Biden acting senile over the past 4 years. Couldn't do it this time. The CNN panel afterward bemoaning how terrible Biden looked was hilarious.

-- I love seeing the Reddit liberals flounder around today. They went from saying that Joe Biden is so great to ""why do we have to choose between these two candidates :( "" Love it. I hope the Reddit liberals who very obviously pretend to be conservatives on this sub are hit the hardest.

-- The golf bickering was the most energy they had all night, and it was awesome lol

-- Biden did not have a cold. That's a bullshit excuse. He didn't exhibit any cold symptoms other than being dumb.

-- Jill Biden escorted Joe down the stairs after the debate. I saw today on a major subreddit the liberals trying to cover this up by spinning it as Joe Biden embracing his wife after the debate while Trump just walked off stage without his wife. That spin won't work. Again, libs rely on snippets of truth instead of truth in context because they know they're full of it.

-- The format CNN used was finally the way that debates should have always been. The questions they asked were mostly pretty good questions. Finally, the moderators got into their heads that the moderators are not running for president, and that they should not be talking or debating with the candidates. The CNN mods asked their questions, enforced time limits, and sometimes repeated their questions. Good.

-- Trump had a few phenomenal lines like ""I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said either"" and ""he's right. He did beat Medicare. He beat it to death.""

-- Trump and Biden were both pretty well prepared. Biden spouted off some buzzwords and numbers that he had obviously rehearsed. Unfortunately for Biden, he couldn't keep himself together enough to maintain discipline and say his points coherently. Biden struggled to follow the clock and regularly had to be stopped by moderators. Trump always was able to end his point before the clock ran out. Trump was actually pretty clever with how he answered a lot of the questions. There were some questions where no matter what he said, it would make him look bad; Trump was smart enough to talk around the question and use up his time as opposed to directly groveling. Trump had a lot more discipline in this debate than he did in 2020's debates, and I think he looked way better and likable this time.

-- Trump really missed on the most important question of the night in terms of tactics. The most important question was about Israel. This is the question where Trump could convince a huge part of the Democrat voter base to stay home and not vote at all. Instead, Trump used his time to unnecessarily add details to a previous question about Ukraine. Trump didn't take the opportunity to get a slam dunk.

-- Trump's best moments were when he was shitting on Biden. In terms of winning over voters, that's the best angle. Trump was less impressive when he talked about how great his term was. For example, when Joe Biden babbled about how economist experts thought the Biden economy was great, Trump's best answer was saying that families struggling to afford food prove them wrong. But Trump's answer starts to fall flat when he says that economists and advisors of his own said the Trump economy was great. No one gives a fuck about an ""expert"" saying an economy is great. It is a much stronger message to point to the real prices that people see every day.

-- Joe Biden saying that no soldiers died under him is absolutely disgusting. Trump should've blasted him for that line.

-- Did Joe Biden's debate trainers never tell Joe that he should close his mouth while on camera?

-- Joe Biden slipped in and out of being senile and being capable. Some people have hypothesized that he's on a drug ""wake up"" cocktail and that an hour and a half was just too long for that cocktail to work. Sounds about right to me.

-- Truthfully, the lasting impact of the debate will not be the substance of the answers. The lasting impact will solely be that Joe Biden looks like an old fool. I was really doubtful that Trump could win this election, but now I think Trump has the advantage. If there are a couple more debates like this, Trump will solidify his upper hand.",2024-06-28

The math is turning more and more in Donald Trump’s favor, but the Democrat’s have one major road to victory that is very plausible: sweep Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.  Trump has taken away almost all the southern states, several of the western swing states, and is getting uncomfortably close in some more traditional Democrat states, but it won’t matter if Joe Biden can win those three states.  All three are city vs. town, urban vs. suburban, makers vs. takers.  Campaign hard where the regular people are.

2. There is one major swing demographic that can give one or the other the victory: white married women.  They are notoriously fickle, vote with their emotions, and their vote can absolutely make the difference.  Donald Trump needs to be going to the affluent suburbs of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Detroit, and Milwaukee, speaking directly to these women.  “I know you didn’t vote for me in 2020, but here is the chance to fix the mess Joe Biden and the Washington establishment.  I will go back to fixing the economy. I will lower gas prices. I will make sure your children will be able to afford college, I will lower home ownership prices.  If you remember what life was like in 2019, I get back to that and make it better.

3. Keep campaigning with Blacks and Hispanics.  Enthusiasm is a real thing and if Donald Trump can find a way to get a 5% gain among blacks and hispanics, he can turn the tide in the above swing states as well.  He needs to go to Hispanic voters and say, “Those of you who are green card carriers and citizens, you are my people and I will fight for you.  I have never threatened you or attempted to deport any legal immigrant.  The people who cross over falsely, those who didn’t do it the right way, like many of you did, those are the people who are hurting us.  By standing by me, there will be more jobs for you.  Your children will have access to far more, and your family will be better off.”  He should go to blacks and say, “Are you better off now or in 2019?  Was your life on the rise then or now? Democrats have promised you many things in the past seventy-five years, and yet many of your family members are living poverty.  In my presidency, I will make sure that the rising tide lifts all boats, and that if you have the desire to work and to raise yourself from poverty, that you will make it.”

4. Focus on domestic issues.  Foreign policy is important, but it is not what the American people care about.  They want to know where the jobs are, whey gas prices are twice as high as they should be, and why their kids aren’t being educated about anything other than woke politics.  Hit those themes, and hit them hard.  I would tell people that every avenue will be opened to get the pipelines moving, that gas taxes will be lowered, that the federal government will get out of the way of job creation and retail prices.  I would focus on letting people know that their real spending power will go up, not down.

5. Be unrelentingly positive.  Pull a page from Ronald Reagan’s book.  Tell people that they have a bright future if they would work with him.  “Joe Biden has already promised to raise taxes, you will feel it in your pocket, and you’ve already experienced it the last for years.  But it doesn’t have to be that way: we will heal the wounds that the last four years opened up.  We will bring back jobs and make sure that you can have a better life, and I will work to ensure that you will have a better life for yourself and your family.  Work with me, vote for me, and in the next four years, we will make America great again.”

**tl;dr**

**Midwest Focus**: Joe Biden needs to win Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania to counter Donald Trump’s gains in the South and West. These states are critical, and the campaign should target rural and suburban voters.

**Target Demographic**: White married women in affluent suburbs are crucial swing voters. Trump should appeal to them by focusing on economic issues, such as lowering gas prices and improving home ownership.

**Minority Outreach**: Trump should seek to increase support among Black and Hispanic voters by highlighting economic improvements during his presidency and promising job growth and opportunities.

**Domestic Issues**: The focus should be on jobs, gas prices, and education rather than foreign policy. Emphasize plans to boost the economy, lower gas taxes, and increase spending power.

**Positive Messaging**: Adopt an optimistic approach, similar to Ronald Reagan, promising a brighter future with job creation and economic growth, contrasting Biden's policies: Joe Biden needs to win Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania to counter Donald Trump’s gains in the South and West. These states are critical, and the campaign should target urban and suburban voters.",2024-06-29

Immunity can still be overcome if prosecutors and courts show that doing so does not hinder the job of the office of the president. Assassinating a political rival would fall in this category.

I am also aware that fireworks are often used to symbolize patriotism and are extensively used around July 4th. But I have recently learned about the harm that can be caused by fireworks, including through polluting air and water. Below is a list of some of the harm done:

1. Pollution:  Fireworks contain gunpowder and various metals to create the different colours observed. Particles from these fireworks then become airborne causing a health hazard to people as those particles will be inhaled. And those particles will also settle on the ground or water polluting those areas as well.  There is also often plastic debris which may be left on the ground after events.
2. Injuries:  Around 10,000 emergency room visits and around a dozen deaths caused by fireworks are recorded within the U.S. every year.
3. Triggering PSTD episodes for veterans:  Many veterans suffer from PTSD and hearing fireworks explosions, seeing the bright flashes, or smelling the smoky air often causes them great discomfort or causes a PTSD episode.
4. Disturbing others:  Some people will undoubtedly be trying to sleep while others are igniting fireworks. And the fireworks would obviously hinder their sleep. I recently saw a post from a mother who was furious about firework usage while she was trying to let her newborn baby sleep.
5. Fires:  Fireworks started an estimated 31,000 or so fires in the U.S. in 2022. These fires included structure fires and vehicles fires, but mostly consisted of outside fires or wildfires.
6. Wildlife disturbance:  Wild animals are often very frightened or disorientated from fireworks. Animals, including the bald eagle, may abandon their nests and try to escape the disturbance. This can lead to the death of their young, and even the adult animals themselves if they crash into buildings or fly too far out to sea.
7. Pets:  Many pets are also terrified of the disturbance caused by fireworks and will escape the house, yard, or owner. This often ends up with them being hit by vehicles or ending up at an animal shelter. Apparently many animal shelters routinely euthanize animals already under their care to free up space for the influx of animals they expect to receive around the holidays.
8. Expense:  It is estimated that Americans spent around $2.3 billion on fireworks last year. This is around three times higher than the amount from ten years ago. And based on weight, the use of consumer fireworks is now over four times greater than it was in 2000.

I understand that many people enjoy fireworks, but the use of fireworks is not harmless. And if fireworks are to be used, they should be used in a responsible manner.

I would encourage people to minimize their usage of fireworks or observe public shows already arranged by professionals rather than buying and using their own fireworks, because doing so should help to mitigate some or all of the above listed concerns.

>I have nearly 3,000 delegates, making me the presumptive nominee of our party by a wide margin.

>‘This was a process open to anyone who wanted to run. Only three people chose to challenge me. One fared so badly that he left the primaries to run as an independent. Another attacked me for being too old and was soundly defeated. The voters of the Democratic Party have voted. They have chosen me to be the nominee of the party.

>Do we now just say this process didn’t matter? That the voters don’t have a say?  
  
I decline to do that. I feel a deep obligation to the faith and the trust the voters of the Democratic Party have placed in me to run this year. It was their decision to make. Not the press, not the pundits, not the big donors, not any selected group of individuals, no matter how well intentioned. **The voters — and the voters alone — decide the nominee of the Democratic Party.** How can we stand for democracy in our nation if we ignore it in our own party? I cannot do that. I will not do that,

Superdelegates can’t vote in the first round. If “the voters alone” are deciding, that means it is a first round-only decision, when the superdelegates are barred from voting. This appears to reflect an assumption that the DNC will not be contested.

But by writing a general sense, this can also be read as if he is either ignorant about superdelegates, or is lying about them.

Because wars cause deficit spending, the Selective Service at the same time serves as a deterrent against deficit spending. Conscription for war and selection for jury both require citizens to render service. For some British subjects in the past, biden days were also required of them.

In the 19th century, some areas allowed you to work off your property tax bill by improving the roads. More notoriously, African-Americans would be fined for being unemployed and then made to work off their fines. Both of these American practices carried on the tradition of the historical British practice of requiring free labor on biden days to pay the local lord for the privilege of being able to farm his land.

The 13th and 14th Amendments serve as an obstacle for restoring the practice of biden days, but they are not insurmountable. They do not prevent inmates from being compelled to work. Congress could pass a law criminalizing lobbying for peacetime deficit spending. The victim of this crime are the future generations. The Constitution protects their liberty:

>We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity...

It follows that debt-servitude is an offense against the liberty of the posterity, and the authority to protect this would fall under the general welfare clause.

Congress members themselves are immune to crimes, so it is not possible to convict them personally for the crime of peacetime deficit spending.

Instead, the crime could be defined as low-level offense similar to a traffic ticket, as follows:

A. **The perpetrators are limited to registered lobbyists**... Has the individual been registered as a lobbyist during the time when deficit spending incurred?

B. **Successful incitement of Congress or the Executive Branch** (to engage in spending)… Has the lobbyist been documented asking for something that costs money? (This would involve more documentation, either compiled by the lobbyist’s own paperwork or by congressional or executive offices.)

C. **Degree of harm** (Congress engages in deficit spending)... The amount of the fine should equal the amount of the deficit, divided by the number of lobbyists for the year who engaged in Incitement of Congress. In 2023 there were 12,937 registered lobbyists.

In the event that the three conditions are met, the registered lobbyists would each be given a ticket for the offense of deficit spending. The ticket would require either money or actual labor, defined as a certain number of biden days. Each biden day would be defined as equal to a certain amount of money. The model for this would be the posted signs which say $500 fine or up to 30 days in jail. If you can’t pay the $500, you go to jail to serve your time.

For the lobbyist, unless they can pay off the actual fine in dollar amounts, they will instead be sentenced to work biden days. All lobbyists who asked for things which cost money would be required to work the same number of biden days, unless they can pay the fine in dollars.

The lobbyists would have to work off the ticket by being assigned to fill the labor needs which would otherwise be filled by illegal immigrants. Businesses could voluntarily apply to receive biden day labor. The lobbyists could keep a percentage of their pay, but the rest would be sent as remittances to the U.S. government to help reduce the deficit. It would only be a symbolic amount in the whole scheme of the federal deficit, but it would ensure that they at least feel some of the pain the future generations must bear.

Just like with traffic tickets, lobbyists would accrue points on their record. The points for each lobbyist would expire over every Congressional or election cycle, but would need to be publicly reported for each organization they represent, as part of the existing documentation.

Yes, it really is called biden days. Proof… [

>On the lord’s *biden* days, or *bederepe*; so many days’ work at harvest time, to be done for the lord, at his summons. This tenure did not strictly entitle them to be called free tenants; the verdict of a jury in 1203-5, in the case of Prior Geoffry, of Canterbury, as to the land of a tenant, was *non est francum tenementum, sed ad furcam et flagellum ad falcandum et metendum* Add MSS. 6037, c. 1810

>PRECARLAE, or PRECES (Law Lat.) In old English law. Days’ works which tenants of some manors were bound, by reason of their tenure, to do for the lord in harvest.

Spelman; Cowell.

Still another… [

>BOON-DAYS, days works, which the tenants of some manors are obliged or *bound* to perform for the benefit of their lord gratis. Vast quantities of land in the northern counties, particularly in Cumberland, are held under lords of manors by *customary* tenure subject to the payment of fines and heriots, and the performance of various duties and services on the *boon* days. Spelman, vo. precariæ, refers to “BIDEN DAYS,” quod Sax. “*Dies precarias* sonat, nam *bidden* est orare et precari;” and gives a curious extract from the Great Book of the Monastery of Battel, where the custom is plainly set forth.

Google renders the Latin as *it sounds precarious, for we must pray and be prayed for .*

The meaning of “Biden” was apparently known well enough in the 1800s for “Lord Biden” to be a character in a legal joke. The name itself was part of the joke, because just like how things operated with *biden* days in feudalism, those serving on juries are conscripted … [

We need to remember that even if Trump were to win in November, it will NOT be a cakewalk after that.

It will not suddenly be better day one. If we look back at his first term, it was four years of “resistance” by the left and the establishment in DC. They couldn’t stand someone, who would buck the gravy train and the status quo, was in the White House so we got four years of an incompetent independence counsel on “collusion with Russia”, a wimpy arrogant FBI head who betrayed his office to usurp the POTUS, and constant media barrage hell along with the far left burning down their own neighborhoods, filing in coloring books, and screaming into the sky on busy streets like children. 

It will NOT be suddenly better. So instead of looking slowly at the election, we need to look ahead at the next four years. Even if the GOP were to win back all of Congress: 

1. RINOs exist in Congress and will not easily (if at all) support the POTUS and likely will simply lock step with the Dems
2. Two major US allies went far left recently so we know how they’ll be towards a GOP Presidency
3. They’ll find another reason to “investigate” the election loss and some sort of charge for “treason and impeachment” and drag us all through that mud again.

Based on these reports, popular visited subreddits are now claiming he was a ""Trumper trying to martyr \[Donald Trump\]"" and are shifting the narrative against Republicans.  In anticipation of the media running off with these narratives, here are facts for you to be aware about.

* The shooter's name was Thomas Matthew Crooks, a [20-year-old]( from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. The shooter was born in [September 2003]( [DW reports]( that his mother is a registered Democrat and his father is a registered Libertarian. 
* The [shooter wore a Demolition Ranch shirt]( Demolition Ranch is an apolitical firearms-content Youtube channel.  Despite what many are claiming, it is not alt-right content.
* He was a registered Republican. A report suggests he [registered in September 2021]( upon turning 18.  He has not voted for Trump as [this year’s presidential election would have been the first he was old enough to vote in.](
* The records ""show that his one known political donation, for $15 in 2021, was to Act Blue, a group that supports Democratic candidates."" [CNBC]( [StarAdvertiser]( Through Act Blue, he specifically donated to the Progressive Turnout Project. [Some reported]( that this donation was made the day Biden was sworn into office in January 2021.
* ""The motive is still not clear"" via an expressed manifesto. But what is clear is that he tried to permanently silence a Presidential candidate. An attempt to assassinate a Presidential candidate is an act clearly politically motivated against Trump and Republicans. (Some people need this spelled out to them.)

Based on these facts, it's inconclusive to determine Crooks, a progressive donor, was a Republican-gone-rogue just because he registered as Republican ([Reddit democrats admit this is a tactic]( to affect primaries; this is known as [cross-voting covered here](  Regardless he's definitely **anti-Trump**.  That's the only point that actually matters.  Any argument that begins or ends with ""But the shooter was a Republican"" is diverting away from this fact.",2024-07-14

I have some ideas.","We have been thrust into the limelight, our views and values, by this unfortunate incident. For the moment, President Trump is in the rare position of holding the moral high ground, by virtue of his near-assassination. Remember the old saying, ""Never let a crisis go to waste""? I know it sounds flippant, but it is what it is.

Every forum I've visited has pages and pages of the worst Democratic and progressive vitriol on display. Wishes that the gunman's aim had been better, etc. Stomach-turning hatefulness. Perusing these messages, I wanted to respond in kind, but I paused. *We have been given an opportunity to show that we're better than that.""

Maybe it's time to take a page from Jesus' playbook. Jesus told us to love our enemies and pray for the ones who persecute us. Paul expounded further on this idea, writing (emphasis mine), ""Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God’s wrath. ...If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head. *Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.*""

I realize not everyone here is a Christian, but I think this advice is solid regardless of your path. Imagine the impact we could make right now if we set out to *overcome evil with good*! If our reaction was not more hateful vitriol (even if such is warranted) but ... charity? Patience? Kindness, faith, hope? Do we not have an opportunity here to change hearts and minds, to change the tone of the discourse, if we can manage to rise to the occasion, instead of simply grinding our axes?

Yeah I know it's hard. It's hard to hold one's tongue and avoid replying in anger, especially online where you're anonymous and won't be held to account for your words. I know this as much as anyone; I've probably said some really nasty things over the years, out of frustration and disdain. But maybe I can be better than that. I'm going to give it a shot.

And I hope when he addresses the convention in a couple of days, President Trump can rise above it too, and deliver a message of positivity, envisioning a bright future for this country. Perhaps this terrible incident can be a turning point, a rock bottom from which we ascend. I really hope so. I'm going to try to do my part. Care to join me?",2024-07-14

This was Trump's fault because of his rhetoric (let's ignore the left is now sanitizing their political messaging that maybe Trump isn't super hitler)

The shooter was a registered Republican so therefor its Republicans fault (which contradicts previous media narrative that true Republicans are never Trump)

This is actually a gun problem

The real problem is the shooter missed (see the HOW COULD YOU MISS trend on X immediately after the incident)

He doesn't recant on his parties stochastic terrorist slogans of ""end of our democracy"" or ""fascist dictatorship"", etc.  
  
It seems that when the dems call for ""unity"" all they actually want  is the right to acquiesce to all their demands.  That's ""unity"" to them.  Even the MSM news articles aren't decrying the violence of the left.  They are all hyper-focused on how MAGAs might respond to this.

The main argument I'm seeing is: ""Biden called Trump 'the greatest threat to our nation' several times"" vs ""Trump called Biden a threat to Democracy too""

In my mind, this obfuscates the true problem and twists us Conservatives into making an anti-free speech argument. Let me be clear: ALL politicians use hyperbolic language and talk about metaphorically 'fighting' against something or stopping the other guy because they're 'the biggest threat' to something.

Here's the thing though: The speech of AN INDIVIDUAL doesn't matter! A politician can't be held responsible for a nut who would take that as a call to physically fight. (Don't get me wrong, during the Floyd Riots there were definitely politicians endorsing the violence, all while pretending they cared about WuFlu distancing, but that distracts from the main point and is different from this one lone nut)

THE CORE POINT: I'm no Constitution expert, but free speech applies to an individual. Trump calling the system corrupt is protected speech, as is Trump or Biden hurling insults at each other. However, the System/Establishment/Deep State/Whatever does not have the same protection. The System, with every pawn politician, agency, media network under their control, acting as separate entities but all on the same email chain, receiving the same instructions, parroting the same talking points, and ignoring the same realities in a coordinated 8+ year effort to villainize one man, is an actual problem. That's the very definition of propaganda and it's definitely responsible for radicalizing room temp IQs and the ignorant youth.

I mean, the twerp was 20, right? So he's been exposed to this propaganda almost half his life and during his formative years. Don't get me wrong, I believe in individual autonomy (He was at fault for his actions), but I don't discount the attempt by the System to mold such a useful idiot.

To conclude, I don't think it's wrong to show the posts of prominent people calling Trump Hitler, but it needs to be in the context of the bigger picture: THE SYSTEM is calling Trump Hitler, a dictator, etc. because they know that some fools will believe it and almost all of us would kill Hitler or Hitler 2.0. It's not even bad; It's your civic duty. It would be wrong not to kill a dictator. That's their angle. That's the main point I don't see being discussed.

Let me know what you think or what I'm missing.

I found one other reference Trump made to Paul Pelosi where he called the situation sad. He was attacked by the media for asking what happened. Apparently this is promoting 'far right conspiracies.'

“Wow, it’s — weird things going on in that household in the last couple of weeks. Probably, you and I are better off not talking about it. The glass it seems was broken from the inside to the out so it wasn’t a break in, it was a break out. I don’t know, you hear the same things I do,” Trump said. 

“It’s a lot of bad stuff and I’m not a fan of Nancy Pelosi, but what’s going on there is very sad,” Trump continued.

Surely NO ONE is undecided after 8 years of Trump and 4 years of direct Biden and another 8 him as VP. So, are these just Bidenettes who want him gone, but will absolutely come crawling back to the battle box in November? 

My thought is thats fairly likely. We've seen in the polls that Bidens debate only lost him 1-2%, Trumps trumped up charges hardly cost him that, and it looks like the assassination attempt hasn't moved much either (still yet to be confirmed but likely does not).

When Trump was in office I was happy when he was bully the other NATO countries into spending more gdp towards defense. They got scared and It probably prepared nato better for Russia than anything else. Now that NATO understands they cant relay on USA it makes them stronger.  Since ww1, approximately once every 14 years  the United States participates in major engagements. The longest peacetime was 23 years between ww1 to ww2. The shortest peacetime 5 years between ww2 and the Korean War. With how volatile geopolitics are these days it’s safe to assume within 14 years after ending the war on terror the United States will be engaged in another major conflict. At the time Vietnam was the longest war and it took 15 years to start another near peer war.

Where were these community organizers when this incident occurred? Or where were they back when the Sisonites held an event with about 500 people in Chicago in the fall of 2023? They could have “de-escalated” the people who held down a man and cut off his dreadlocks simply because his skin was the wrong color, so they thought, for him to be having dreadlocks. Same goes for the attendees who started a fire, or the ones who vandalized a security camera. They could have used “mediation” to convince all the naked people to either cover up or go inside.

This assertion of pure and non-violent intentions relates to one of the Sisonites’ decades-old strategies. Sison was careful to separate the legitimate political machinery and the dirty terroristic operations by setting up different mutually-supporting organizations in the Philippines. American Sisonites also have separate organizations for differing purposes. The outcome is to allow the ILPS to be approved to do a legitimate, permitted protest like this one. Meanwhile, Students for Justice in Palestine gets the bad reputation for trashing campuses. The public is expected to look the other way about the fact the National SJP is member of the ILPS, and shares in its governance.

There is a leftist group in Pittsburg which has overtly promoted assassination on social media over the last few years. The group also posted pro-assassination things following the events of July 13th in Butler, Pennsylvania. This particular leftist group is anarchist instead of Sisonite, but expresses some solidarity with FTP groups by selling small, wearable pins with “FTP” on them, and by promoting something from of the local Maoist groups outside of the area.

FTP (For the People) groups are Sisonite, since together, the groups made up the OC-MCP (Organizing Committee for a Maoist Communist Party), which belonged to the ILPS. Daniel Greenfield wrote a good [journalistic treatment of one of the 2020 incidents]( which was perpetrated by an FTP group. Proof that an FTP group was behind it is found in the supporting links.

Choice 1: Wheel Grandpa Joe across the finish line at the convention and keep him as the nominee.  This would be their best choice, but with the latest news of his continued failing health, seems less and less likely.

Choice 2: Replace him with Kamala.   To accomplish this would not be easy, or definite.

Essentially the Heritage foundation wants to change policy so that the President can fire deep state operatives at will and place other people in charge who would obey policy.

I don't honestly disagree with that and I don't think it's a big deal.  If your beliefs are such that you cannot follow company policy then you should remove yourself and find a new job.  It makes sense that an employer, even the government, would have an interest in their staff obeying lawful orders.  I don't think that's fascist.  If you're being ordered to commit genocide well that would be a fascist order but if you're being ordered to loosen restrictions on the water pressure that's allowed for shower heads I think that's something that falls into the category of things reasonable people can disagree on.  Even if you have strong beliefs on climate change that compel you to desire weak shower heads you're just going to have to eat it on that one or run for president yourself.

Some of their other concerns are things like using the FDA to remove the approval of abortion pills.  I fail to see how that is fascist, even a full pro-life position isn't fascist at all.  The soldiers who stormed the beaches of Normandy to overthrow fascism all hailed from the USA which had a complete abortion ban at every stage in place at the time.  Conservatives using federal authority to ban an abortion pill is merely conservatives doing conservative things.  It's almost like elections have consequences or something, if you want universal access in all 50 states forever you need to pass an amendment that's how this works.

Another thing I see them concerned about is that the project discusses restrictions on pornography.  I actually  don't think pornography should be legal, but I'm okay standing alone on that one.  That said, there's no reason it needs to be super easy to get to.  Requiring people to upload an ID or something makes sense and would help keep it away from children.  The left doesn't seem to think that requiring an ID to purchase firearms is fascist and that's our second amendment, why would it be fascist to require an ID for pornography?

And then after that it trails off into the bizarre.  They are worried that if Trump wins this will be our last election and we will become Gilead, they think that LGBTQ people will be rounded up into concentration camps, and other nonsense things like that.  It's a lot of fear porn basically but it gets some people riled up.  We have that kinda stuff, just differently, on our side too so maybe I shouldn't judge too hard.

When you remove the windmill tilting and wacky interpretations Project 2025 just reads to me like a policy recommendation that Trump may or may not choose to use parts of.  Some of it sounds like I'm being threatened with a good time to be quite honest.  So that's my takeaway I'm open to yours.  Did I miss something important?",2024-07-18

Let's be brutally honest here, Kamala Harris was someone chosen by how much her genes tick all the boxes to get the shallow diversity voters. She's someone that's been hidden from the public as much as Joe was because she was that unlikeable. Black voters who can do just a little bit of research would be turned off by her arresting black people for truancy back in the 90s. The only voters she could secure are the people that only care about diversity.

Also her optics are terrible, the Trump campaign should use this angle if she's elected as the nominee but her optics are that she's someone that either hitchhiked a man to become the presidential nominee or someone that became the first ever black female president, but she's not elected into that office. If I were the Trump campaign manager I would, for the lack of a better term, fearmonger that Kamala Harris snatching the title of being the first female president as somebody that inherited, not voted on by the people. I believe that will scare off female voters in a 60/40 split for the Democrats, but securing 40 percent of the female vote would 1000% guarantee  Trump and the Republicans will win reelection and take back the house and Senate.

Tons to misinformation over the Trump campaign floods the internet and as an undecided voter I spend a ton of time reading about the different candidates. One of the biggest things I’ve noticed are discrepancies in how Trump’s platform reported. 


The first thing I want to address is that **Agenda 47** is real. 

It’s his offices platform found on his official website. It’s even called “Agenda 47” in the URL. I’ve seen people here claim Agenda 47 is another left wing invention, but it’s not. Please read about it on his website at the links below. 



So let’s be clear, Agenda 47 is Donald Trump’s platform. It’s in his website. It’s literally his platform on his website. 

It’s clear as day. 

There’s even a link to a 16 page easy to digest platform pdf file 



This is his official platform. End of story.

*****

What is **Project 2025?**

Well, it is *not* Trump’s platform. Project 2025 is a proposed policy platform created by the Heritage Foundation, a very conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C.  They have created policy platforms for all presidential candidates in the past in hopes of pushing conservative Christian-centric policies into the presidential platform.  They are not new. They are not representative of the president. They are essentially a lobbying group that focuses on influencing presidential and down trace policy. 

So, to clarify, Project 2025 is not Trump platform. It wouldn’t shock me if there was some crossover, that’s bound to happen. But the nearly 1,000 page Project 2025 proposal is not Trump’s agenda. It’s an independent policy “wish list” from an independent think tank that push very conservative Christian values in hopes of influencing national policies.

*****

Furthermore, a common claim I’ve seen is that Agenda 47 is just the Trump campaign name for Project 2025. 

This is categorically false. 

You can read both of them online. I’m not going to link to the Project 2025 stuff but you can easily find it yourself if you’re curious. 

**Agenda 47 is vastly different from Project 2025.** Project 2025 is much more conservative, traditionally conservative, than anything Trump is putting out. Dare I say, Trump has much more of a libertarian-leaning states’ rights focus on his agenda than anything you can find within Project 2025, which is essentially the wet dream of Dick Cheney. 

So, I just wanted to put that out there. I hope this helps at least some people understand what these two things are.

*This post is to verify that Reddit is somehow filtering out negative commentary about Kamala Harris.

I am trying very hard to learn about the history of Kamala Harris. It feels like the Internet has been scrubbed of anything about her prior to 2020. I have heard that she slept with her boss to get into politics and that she put people in prison for smoking marijuana and then laughed about it when asked later, but I legitimately can't find a source compelling enough that I could show it to my friends with any confidence.

What is her history? What are her accomplishments good or bad? What are the strongest arguments against her?

•	⁠has been caught plaigiarizing his entire life, including in law school and during his failed 1988 presidential campaign

•	⁠smeared Anita Hill and castigated her during her testimony in the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings.  Whatever happened to “believe all women”  ?????????????

•	⁠refuses to interact with or acknowledge his 7th grandchild, Navy Joan

•	⁠carries a rosary around in his pocket to virtue signal, while supporting legislation completely opposed by the Catholic Church

•	⁠cleared over [20 confirmed lies]( during the last debate

- he and his inner circle have lied about his deteriorating mental condition for over 4 years.  We knew it when he hid in the basement during all of 2020, but he made the representation to the entire world since then that he was “fit for duty.”

- blamed the death of Beau for why he didn’t run in 2016, when it turns out, as he just admitted, that it was because the “Democrat” party passed him over to select Hillary instead.

One of the most infamous lies (assuming that readers only look at the headlines) was from Reuters:

>Fact check: Kamala Harris did not say she listened to Snoop Dogg and Tupac while smoking marijuana in college

...

>Later in the interview, DJ Envy asks Harris what music she listens to. Before she has a chance to answer, Charlamagne Tha God interrupts by asking what music Harris listened to while smoking marijuana in college.  Harris laughs but ignores Charlamagne Tha God’s question and responds to the original query of what music she listens to by saying “Snoop Dogg”, “Tupac” and adds that she loves “Cardi B”.

Reuters says explicitly ""Harris laughs but ignores Chalamagne the God"". However, you can clearly hear that the co-host is adding on to Charlamagne's questions by saying ""**was it** Snoop?"", after Charlamagne asked his question. Key words is **was.** He continued in past tense, taking key from the host. He did not say **is it** Snoop (and for those reasons, Reuters, I'm out).

She was CLEARLY not answering the original question of ""what kind of music does Kamala Harris listen to"" since it was cut off in the middle by the star and creator of the show, Charlamange, asking what she listened to when ""you was high""...

Anyone that acts like going on a radio show, and ignore the question from the host, is just trying to mislead you. That is not how radio shows, work. You ignore the host, and it goes straight to commercials, and you are not coming back on.

She was obviously lying to try to fit herself into the crowd she was with. If she is lying in that kind of low stakes environment, do people really think she doesn't have the capacity to lie in a high stakes environment? Just look at her history as a prosecuter.

I find it very weird that Biden's exit from the presidential race would be announced by a simple tweet; usually, you would hold a press conference and give a speech to announce something that big. Biden was also very intent on telling everyone that he was not dropping out and that he would continue the race. Then, overnight, everyone who used to support him turned on him, and his resignation was posted in a tweet.

Not to mention, it was also reported that Biden got COVID, and his last public appearance was five days ago, where he looked very frail and weak and had to be physically supported by other people. The signature on his resignation letter also looks photoshopped. There was no presidential seal, and I think it's pretty obvious that it's not actually Biden on his Twitter account.

His supposed ""phone call"" to Kamala Harris is also very suspicious ([

Kamala trips over her words and almost says ""recording"" instead of call. Biden also just sounds very weird throughout this supposed ""call,"" and I wouldn't be surprised if it was some kind of AI voice.

Of course, there could be a simpler explanation, and the Democrats simply saw him as a liability and wanted him out, but I can't get this weird feeling out of me that he's dead.

First one is the magical ""VP Pick"" - it's probably Cooper from NC or M. Kelly from AZ.

There's one side of me who thinks - Yes, until that banner hits 270, we should NOT get complacent and win no matter who it is.

There's another side of me who thinks - Pelosi/Obama/Schumer have pretty much seen the writing on the wall. For them Kamala, is the fall guy. Biden gets to save his legacy by being the guy who saw the writing on the wall and couldn't continue out of his selflessness, Kamala could help dems save their downballot bleeding, I think they know the Presidency is unattainable.

Healthcare costs continue to go up because we have 20,000 PAGES of federal healthcare regulations.

Conservative,t3_1ebc26j,2024-07-24 22:42:56,67,0.7599999904632561,A quick intro on the “4% Buffer” used for National Polls,"So, it’s come to my attention that most people don’t know about the 4% buffer for national presidential polling, and I’ve learned that it’s *impossible* to find anything about it via a Google search, despite it being easy for me to find when I learned about it during the 2016 primaries. I worked for the Gary Johnson campaign and was good friends with a staffer that worked for Clinton’s campaign and he introduced it to me because he was tasked with finding out how Johnson’s polling was jacking up their formulas. He was one of the only democrats I knew that thought Hillary was going to lose going into election night. 

Anyways, seeing as we’re hitting prime “polling” season, I want to make sure I share it with all of you. 

*****

TL;DR: You need to give the Republican Candidate a ~4% buffer in national polling to account for how densely located democrat voters are. 

*****

Longer version: 

The fact that democratic voters are largely centralized around population centers means that many of their votes are “wasted”.

For an example of what I mean: 

In 2016 Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 2.8 million. 

She won California by 4.3 million. 

She won New York by 1.7 million. 

She won Illinois by 1 million.

Trump, however, won the election. 

How? 

He won the electoral college. 

How? 

He won Michigan by 10k votes.  He won Wisconsin by 22k votes. He won PA by 44k votes.

Those millions upon millions of “extra” votes Clinton won in CA, NY, and IL did nothing to help her win the national election.

Campaign strategists are aware of this and give an average of a 4% buffer to the RNC candidate.

So basically, a democrat candidate for president needs to lead national polls by at least 4% to be comfortable in their chances to win the election.

Hillary Clinton’s final polling in 2016 showed her up by an aggregate of 3.6%. She won the popular vote by 2.8 million votes but lost the electoral college 227 to 304. 

For another example. The final aggregate poll for Al Gore in 2000 had him up 1.3%. Gore won the popular vote by 543k votes but lost the electoral college. 266-271. 

Both democrats were up by less than 4% in final aggregate polling and both lost the election. 

“Paddy! You’re just cherry picking! This is such a cope!”

Is it? 
What about other elections? 

Well, let’s look:

Joe Biden in 2020. The final aggregate poll? 5.1%. Biden won. 

Obama in 2012? 4.2%. Obama won. 

Obama in 2008? 5.7%. Obama won. 

Bush in 2004? Final polling showed a draw. Dead even at 49%. (Not so fun fact: This is the only election since 1988 that the GOP candidate won the popular vote)

Clinton had 10%+ leads in aggregate polling in both 1996 and 1992 and won both elections easily. 

State politics have changed a lot since the 80s and the numbers get too muddled to be reliable, especially with how lopsided the Reagan elections were. 

***** 

So, right now, the most up to date polls have Trump up 1.8% over Harris and had him up 3% over Biden.

In reality, this means Trump has about a 5.8% lead over Harris.

For Harris to win, she needs to overcome this 5.8% deficit.

It would be an absolutely shocking comeback, but obviously not impossible. The only reason Bush won in 2000 was because he secured Florida. 

So yea, none of this is to tell anyone to “relax, this is in the bag”, but considering I’ve already received 4 spam texts today alone about how Harris is “leading in the polls” (one poll, Reuters by 2%) I wanted to share this with everyone. I shared it recently in another sub and it was well received and I figured if anyone else would want to know this that might not, it’s people here. 

Also, to clarify, this is only for national head to head polling. Not state polling or “3 way matchup” or other variants. Only for national head to head polling. 

Plus, if you *really* want to track how the election is going, you’ll pay attention to state polls instead of random one-off national polls. [Real Clear Politics is my favorite website for my aggregate polling needs, mostly for ease of use.]( tho I always suggest people get their info from as many different sources as possible to avoid biased data.

There are some issues where I still hold a fairly “liberal” stance (abortion, gun safety, I still support some specific government programs, etc.)

But I’m a California resident raised in a SUPER liberal environment where conservatism and the Republic party was always deemed evil and ignorant. One thing I want conservatives to know is that it’s really not the fault of the people who fall under that spell—the brainwashing starts early and runs DEEP. It’s very, VERY difficult to disentangle yourself from it and see things clearly.

What’s ironic is that the reason I’ve started to move further to the right is because I started researching the issues I felt passionately about because I was trying to back up my leftist beliefs! The more I educated myself the more I questioned why I even believed the things I did.

I know that as a California resident my vote doesn’t matter, but I think I’m going to vote Trump this fall. This is coming from someone who ALWAYS voted Dem straight down the line. Who cried tears when Trump won in 2016. I still have some complaints about the guy, he’s far from perfect, but I’m realizing that he far, far, FAR better represents my best interests as an American compared to ANYONE in the major Democratic establishment. And that I was painted a very incomplete picture of him by mainstream media.

Btw I’m a young Indian American woman and Kamala ain’t fooling me. 

Anyone else here converted from left to right? What was your journey like? I’m still very much in the “closet” so I don’t have anyone else to talk to about this. 

EDIT! Since so many people are asking which issues I changed my mind on. Posting some here:

- Gender ideology. I have some trans friends and started very left on this issue. The more I studied it and learned about it, the less I believed in it and the more I felt it encroached on women’s rights. The entire ideology actually makes NO sense when you think about it and the assault on children is unforgivable to me. 

- Immigration. I grew up in the 90s and I remember an era where “illegal” immigrants were mostly hard working, contributing members of society. That has changed. The migrant crisis is out of control and these immigrants are no longer your hard working laborers who love America, they are leeching off the system and worsening the quality of life of hardworking Americans. AND turning around and lambasting the country that has given them such a great life 

- Government size. I used to have this very idealistic view that government was an instrument of good and that the real world White House looked like the TV show The West Wing. I used to support big government because I thought it would help the misfortunate. Now I realize that in our world, bigger government = more corruption 

- being “soft on crime”. Again, I don’t think the justice system is black and white and I do think it has some flaws but I used to believe that being soft on crime was the compassionate thing to do. That most criminals weren’t actually criminals, just unfairly targeted and victimized by the justice system. But I’ve spent most of my adult life between San Francisco and LA and I’ve realize that we cannot live in a society that doesn’t punish crime. And honestly at this point Democrat policies almost incentives crime, which is so difficult to look past 

- Guns. I still support some measures of gun control but I used to support fully repealing the 2nd amendment. I don’t anymore. I’ve lived in the real world now and I understand the need to have a gun (especially as a single woman). I’ve gotten more involved in gun culture and the people have been welcoming and warm and I’ve come to view them in a new light 

-  Taxes. I used to think it was moral to pay taxes through the nose but I’m looking around and wondering—where the hell is all my money going?! Education, infrastructure, housing, etc. have all been continuously going downhill. So why is half my paycheck going into taxes? How is it benefitting me and other Americans?!

- DEI/racism/affirmative action. This is a huge one for me. As an Indian American, affirmative action very much discriminated against me but I was naive enough to think “well that’s a good thing! That’s how things should be! I should have to work harder for the same thing than other races.” Very warped brain state. I’m very well aware that my status as a female “person of color” and as someone who legitimately has some real life claims to “victimhood” could have very much aided me in my career and life in recent years. But I realized I do NOT want that to be a defining factor of my personhood. I don’t want it to be that for anyone’s. We should all be judged for our MERIT. The fact that Kamala was a DEI pick and stands to become the next president without truly earning the position? Embarrassing. We should treat people with compassion and be understanding of individual circumstances but I reject DEI in its entirely and always will. I reject the leftists victomhood narrative wholeheartedly.

I'm 35(m). I grew up in a mostly conservative household with certain liberal values. Neither of my parents had college degrees but I watched them build a very successful business from scratch. I learned to appreciate and see what working for yourself can be from my parents. That is one of the most important lessons they taught me. My parents always voted republican after Clinton. 2008, the year I graduated and the first election I was able to vote in, I voted for Obama. My parents and I had discussions and respectful disagreements at the dinner table over this, explaining their perspective as business owners. And mine as an 18 year old kid enamored at the thought of change. After the 2008 election I never voted again until 2020. From 2008-2020 I largely ignored politics. When I noticed nothing in my life changed at 18 right after voting for Obama I almost had this apathetic trust in our system that no matter who was in office my life would remain unchanged. Everything I wanted in life was available to me so long as I worked hard enough(and SMART enough) to achieve it. Never would I think the government would actually hinder or help my ability with this.

I didn't go to college but I did go to a trade school. I was fortunate as a young teenager to find a passion in working on cars. So when I graduated high school it was a no brainer for me as to what I should do. Two years out of high school and I was already making $60k a year as a mechanic. While all my high school friends were still living off their parents and going to college, I was getting a head start. I excelled in this industry and over the course of 10 years I went from being a mechanic to owning and operating my own shop. We are now one of the highest rated shops in my area, with just one location we are projected to gross close to 2.5 million this year. But I am by no means rich. The margins in this industry are thin and the overhead is wide. Having been a mechanic for many years I also take very good care of my loyal and hardworking employees. My lowest paid employee makes close to 70k a year and is only 23 years old. I have three other employees that make just over $115k a year. Which is more than I pay myself. But owning a business has made me feel like I have more control over my destiny. A stark contrast to my liberal friends who work for giant corporations whom are always seeking government intervention to make their lives easier.

Trumps first term was the first time I noticed a president to have any effect on my life. Our business is incorporated and the Trump corporate tax breaks straight up allowed me to hire an additional employee. This was the catalyst that boomed our business. By 2020 we were killing it. I could see the American Dream clearly. And side note, covid actually helped our business since new cars were hard to come by and used car prices sky rocketed. This meant it was more cost effective for consumers to fix the cars they had rather than trade them in. I saw this as temporary and did my best to not make any drastic decisions around the sudden increase in business. However I did have to hire another employee to keep up. Although we haven't seen as much growth as the recent previous year, we're in pretty good shape. But even all my other shop owner friends would agree, this year seems different. Its been much more difficult to even maintain pre-pandemic numbers. Its obvious consumers are worried about spending money. If this continues and certain small business benefits go away, I fear for more difficult years ahead. I do have faith that we will always figure out a way to keep our current staff. I appreciate my employees so letting someone go will always be the last decision I make after trying everything else. I would further decrease my own pay before letting that happen.

I got engaged this year. Our wedding is planned for August 2025. My Fiancé and I have been really excited to really kick start our ""American Dream"". We want to buy a house. I'm kicking myself for not buying a house in the pre-pandemic market but I always eventually wanted to start a family and was just so focused on the business I figured I would just wait until I met someone special enough to get me to tie the knot. But with the direction the media is forcing the wind to blow with Harris, I am very very worried a Kamala presidency would push our dreams further back. Or negate them all together. I am concerned about the challenges I might face as a parent in a post Kamala America. Let alone small business owner. Suddenly I am now my Dad and nervously watching the news. Except for me it appears I have a much bigger set of problems to deal with than my parents did. God help me.",2024-07-26

(He’s in his mid 40s, professional, if that matters)  Too many times to count our talks have gotten heated and recently he usually snaps and just walks away when politics come up, in my opinion a little too emotional.

But today after I joked to him “hey excited for Kamala 2024” my sister prompts him to “tell me the news” that he’s voting for a Republican and specifically Trump this year for the first time. His justification was since October 7 he’s already been a little disenfranchised with the left’s response, but especially the other day during Netanyahu’s speech, the violence and desecration in DC of our monuments and flag by the rioters put him over the edge. He said Trump would never have allowed that and would have dispatched law enforcement to prevent it or disperse it.

Conservative,t3_1edg65k,2024-07-27 15:17:35,0,0.40999999642372104,How Do We Get The Word Out? Let's Start Here,"There is a narrative of fear-mongering circulating in social media right now about all of the terrible things that will happen if Trump is reelected. The claims that ""you won't have to vote"" in four years because Trump will have installed himself as dictator. The fears about ""Project 2025"" ... etc. How do we combat this? How do we persuade voters that the vast, vast majority of Republicans only want good things for our country? 

Let's start here. I and all of the conservatives I know want:

A constitutional Republic with free and fair elections. No one wants a dictator; that's just silly. 

Peace in the world; American leadership resulting in the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine being resolved, hostages returned, the killing (especially of children) to stop.  

National security which includes strong borders; we can't have people coming in willy-nilly and being given hearing dates years into the future. It is wrong to allow people to establish lives and families here only to deport them. This practice has to end. It's inhumane.

A decent education for all children. No, we don't seek to destroy public schools in order to make a buck off privatizing them; we just want all children to be educated. Right now, too many public schools are failing to do so, and there are no easy ways to turn them around; in fact, with contractual obligations and tenure, there is almost no way to eliminate under-performing staff and replace them. In some cases, the only viable solution has been to start from scratch with an entirely new cast of characters. But if you have a better idea, we'd love to hear it! 

Most conservatives do not care who you choose to sleep with as long as it's a consenting adult and you do so in private. 

I don't know anyone who wants to ""oppress women"" by denying them abortions; we simply view unborn children as CHILDREN and want to protect them, in the same way that you would probably jump to the rescue of a four-year-old about to be hit by a speeding car. That's our entire motivation, wanting to save human lives. There is nothing sinister about it. All of us are deeply troubled about the idea that some conceptions occur as a result of rape or incest and most are willing to grant exceptions under those terrible circumstances out of compassion for the victim.

Every conservative I know believes that we ought to help the poor, elderly, children, disabled, etc. Many of us are OK with government social welfare programs, while some of us think that assistance should come from private charity. But no one wants to see helpless people suffer and die. 

I don't know a single conservative who cares whether you are white, black, brown, green or purple. Regardless of race or national origin, you are welcome in our tent. We object to preferential treatment being given on the basis of race. Let all be judged on their merits and the content of their character. 

Likewise, I don't know a single conservative who cares whether you identify as male, female, neither or something in between. As long as you are a productive citizen and good neighbor, who cares? Do your own thing. Live and let live. 

Finally, the biggest difference between us (conservatives) and you (progressives) is our belief in the role of government. You tend to think that the only way we can have nice things is if the government provides them, either by legislating them or subsidizing them. We disagree. Take something like childcare: you think the government should pay for it or subsidize it. We think families should be able to earn enough, and allowed to keep enough of their earnings through low taxes, to make the decision that is best for them, either to put their child in daycare or for a parent to stay home and take care of them. Rather than raising taxes and redistributing money, we think the solution to nearly all problems is to leave the money in the pockets of the people who earned it and let them figure out what works best for them.

IN CLOSING ... if you agree with me on the above points, please chime in here to let the progressive know that we're not really the strawmen that are being built by the Left. We are not hateful; we are not stupid; we just want our country to be strong, secure, free and prosperous, and if you believe the same, you are welcome to join us. Thank you.",2024-07-27

Kamila Harris was given the nomination by her party without putting together a campaign platform and the media have not really put spotlight on how big of a problem this is.

Without a campaign platform voters have no idea what her current stance is on key issues, what her objectives are, what her vision is and what her timeline will be to execute on her objectives. Without this written down and shared, objectively she is a completely hollow candidate.

It also gives her a complete ""blank check"" on policy, objectives, etc... She's promised nothing so she can deliver anything she wants. Trump is being critiized for not debate her immediately, but how can you debate someone who has no platform? She would be debated on her previous stance as Presidential candidate in 2019 and on Biden's stance on issues and that gives her incredible leverage to dodge questions and chance stance on demand. It's Republican party has to push back on this.

**Strategic replacement of Biden**

I now firmly believe the only reason the Democratic party waited as long as they did to put pressure on Biden to bow out, is because they wanted to wait until after the Republican Convention and for Trump to announce his VP running mate. Well aware that the VP running mate can have impact on votes and be a way to reach otherwise unreachable demographics, they strategically positioned Harris's placement until after Trump had picked a running mate aimed at the Biden-Harris ticket.... This gives the Democrats leverage they shouldn't have.... and Biden isn't bad off enough to leave office and let Harris take over now and be held accountable for decisions she might make, they want her to have a fresh start if elected. None of this is good for the country or honest.

This was the state of the race pre debates. And I was so happy to see that Trump in the first time in history, was leading in the popular vote poll. 

Most polls in 2020 were like Biden +7 or Biden +9 so it's not comparable to now. We were LOSING in 2020. We we’re down 10 in literally all the polls and losing every swing state. In the end we barely lost the EC. I was pretty much checking out but there was a lot of other stuff going on that time in America.  Wasn't confident at all.  Opposite.  Shocked that we held Florida and Ohio.  Look at how badly GOP did in 2008. The same people dooming online were claiming that time that ""polls mean nothing and Biden's advantage is like Hillary"". So a little lesson from history.

VP pick ""bumps"" isn't a real thing. People who failed mathematics all the time would tell you that having just 4% of undecideds left , means you'll get to see a 5% bump for the VP pick and 5% bump for the convention.  
The math doesn't add up. 



This isn't to say we should be complacent. This makes me even more fired up. We should NOT underestimate Harris. Of course she will get a bump from the DNC, but it will no way in hell be more than +2. 

I think the race is now 60-40.

Attachment 4 - Relationship of Parties

Ronnie Dean Stout the 2nd is my “brother”. I have never known a more sadist or depraved individual. He has never acted like a brother to me. Before the age of seven, his terrorization included stabbing me with a pen (twice, two different occassions), stabbing me with a dart. Holding a pillow over my face until I pretended to be dead because I knew if I didn’t pretend that he would not stop until he smothered me as I layed still, he finally stopped…He threw a weight into the deep end of the pool, I believe it was 15 or 20 lbs. Maybe 25, I don’t recall. I was told to jump in and get it. And that it’d be fun. I jumped in, swam down and was unable to retrieve the weight. I swam back up, and before I was able to break the surface, he held my head under the water and again I knew I was going to die if I didn’t think quickly. I lunged off the side of the pool back down 8' to the bottom and in a panic I gripped the iron weight and with all my might I lunged off the bottom of the pool and frantically kicked as hard as I could while carrying the iron weight upwards. I finally broke the surface, all the while kicking, I threw the weight up and over. His tyranny did not end there. As I struggled to climb up the ladder, he pushed me back in and forced me to tread water for what felt like hours, not allowing me to rest or touch the sides of the pool. That was all before the \[missing\]

I had hoped his time in prison would make him better, but he came out much, much worse. Shortly after his release he rаped my fiance. I didn’t find out until months after her and I separated. His disgusting opening line: “why would you wanna be with him, when you could be with me? I’m an FBI agent.” She said “No, your his brother.” He rаped her, she said “You’re going to \[Ƅurn in\] HЕLL for this!” He sickly rebuttled “Yea I’m going to HЕLL and it was worth it.”

\[REDACTED #1\] of whom I was with for 7 years, and have known for 10, told me Ronnie Dean Stout the 2nd was a federal “аgеnt”, but at the time she wouldn’t еlаborate more. She’s too scаred to testify аgainst him judging from our last few conversаtions. Ronnie Dean Stout the 2nd stаlks and hаrаsses me on a daily basis. He has said numerous times: “I’m going to ѕhoot you in the head Clay, doesn’t that ѕcare you?” One of his most аbsurd lines is “I know you hear voices you piece of ѕhit” Implying that I’m crаzy. I’ve never heаrd a voice that doesn’t exist. Tаlking is how we communicate. By far his most diѕturbing phrase — “Hаhа you’re never going to hold hands with anyone.” He’s been tormеnting me my entire Life. Molеѕting me as a child wasn’t enough.

The last time He told me he was going to bеat my dog. I went to pick her up, and shortly after I had to take her to the vet because her bowеl movements smelled like pure blеach.

When I first found out he was аbusing Trinity \[my dog\], I took her from my parents custody. I walked in, she was ѕhaking like a leaf, I went to pet her and she flinched. I then began feeling all over her body and discovered “hot-spots” along her back, neck and forearms as if being hit or kicked repeatedly. I took her with me outside as I cleaned out and made room in my car for her. Shortly after my “brother” pulled up, looked at my dog and said “You wanna get beat again you ѕtupid Ьitch?” It took everything I had not to hurt him. I called the ASPCA and they said they couldn’t do anything. I had intentions of taking her to the humane society, and some how my so called “brother” found out. He informed me that if I took her there he was going to adopt her and 𝚔ill her. I told him I’d tell them that and he said “alright, I’ll have some one else adopt her then i’ll 𝚔ill her.”

Shortly after the first time he thrеatened to ѕhoot me in the hеad, I ovеrhеard a rеlative of ours (\[REDACTED #2\]), tell my dad, “The feds took Ronnie’s gun for threatening \[missing text\]

Aside from ѕtalking me, he targetѕ my friends as well. Along with my acquaintances and every single relationship interest i’ve had. He bribeѕ, threatenѕ, and otherwise ruthleѕѕly victimizeѕ any one who tries to help me. My relationship interests are told that I’m a ѕtalker, and that i’m crazy, which couldn’t be farther from the truth. When his lies don’t have the desired effect, He has no problem carrying out obѕcene acts of intimidation and violence. The latest target is \[REDACTED #3\], she and I are cruelly kept away from each other for the crime of wanting to hold each other’s hand. This is merely the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the cruel and brutal antics I endure on a daily basis. I recently confronted him, and as usual he was drinking a tall can, I told him to stop stalking me, and that he was nothing less than an absolute monstеr. I now have torn ligaments in my left shoulder due to the altercation that ensured. Ronnie Dean Stout the 2nd is either pretending to be a federal agent to get away with pure evil. Or this is the cruelest FBI informant/“agent” ive ever had the absolute misfortune of meeting. I have also heard my dad tell my “brother”, You never should of taken that deal with the feds”. Ronnie Dean Stout the 2nd Replied “I had to or else I’d be doing another (30/40 years)”

I as well as \[REDACTED #3\], need to be protected from the dеrangеd cruelty of the monstеr known as Ronnie Dean Stout the 2nd. He has also admitted to putting ѕtyrofoam/liquid absorbents in the fuel tank of my car. intentionally rippеd out the charging port of my MP3 player, along with countleѕѕ other Ьully tacticѕ. He’s got some sort of sick dеmеntеd еnvious wrath aimed towards me, and he needs help. I will gladly polygraph to any of my tеstimony. And it’d be in the public’s interest to polygraph him on the matter as well. Last, but not least, he replaced the water in my canteen with antifrееzе. Before I rеalizеd it was no longer water I had drank some and I got very sick. He said I should drink it and build up my immunities to it. I missed my welding class that night because I had to go to the hospital. He told me I was a piece of ѕhit for going to the hospital.",2024-07-29

First of all, the accepted vernacular is ""little person"" and what *I* can't beleve is you got something against that kind of porn. I mean, have you SEEN Diana Blake? She's got it all! Beautiful smile, great body, purple hair...



Actually, that was a deliberate switcheroo in reference to the ""lead brainitis"" boomers like yourselves are known to suffer from. I make a simple play on a quote and both the lead joke and the quote itself flies right over your lead-filled heads. SAD!

No wonder rightie comedians all suck.



I hard disagree with both of these statements.



Well you see, homie, there's ""good"" weird and ""bad"" weird. ""Good"" weird is someone having a harmless fetish. ""Bad"" weird would be your boy Donnie wanting to fuck his daughter. Now I wouldn't quite call Vance's couch fetish ""bad"" weird, but objectively speaking it's a hell of a lot weirder than a belly button fetish. Actually, I don't even know if I'd call my fetish weird. More like mildly unusual, maybe?

Either way, you've got no room to talk.



Yeah, this really ain't the ""gotcha"" you fellas seem to think it is. Oh, and uh... are we just going to ignore the fact that you're all backing a daughterfucker/couchfucker combo?



Guess so. Anyway Tradwife(tm), I'm sensing a some prudishness here. You ought to open your mind, try some new things, discover new kinks. Maybe if your sex life were less dull, your hubby would get get sexual gratification from you instead of other women and/or men. I mean, obviously he'll never give it, but gotta take what you can get, right?

And again, it's really not that weird. Full-on weird would be me wanting to fuck my daughter and again, that's bad weird. What kind of weird, smelly old man would think about his own daughter that way? Ick.



You know, there's only so many ways I can say ""at least I don't want to fuck my daughter like the slob you guys literally worship."" And again, I'm really not seeing the insult here.



Kamala's a silver fox. Your guy looks like a 280-pound Oompa Loompa with a wig made out of a yak's ass and a neck that looks like a heavyset 80 year-old woman's lady parts.



I agree. A man wanting to fuck his own daughter is about as weird it gets. And thinking a belly button fetish is somehow weirder than that is quite weird in of itself.

Tbh, I'm actually a little jealous of how weird y'all are. Like, yeah, it's the ""bad"" weird but I can't help but envy that kind of power... It's like being a Padawan in a room full of Sith Lords.



Ok, that's it! I'm making a drinking game out of this. Every time another daughterfucker-worshipping, horse dewormer-eating, book-burning, trans-obsessed, rainbow-hating, ammosexual goofball comes on and says I'm weird for a mildly unusual fetish(or two), I drink a Bud Light.

So Biden and Harris – the people whose #1 job is to protect our national security and the lives of every American – have now done the exact opposite and placed us all in grave danger by assisting and enabling our sworn enemies – who have publicly threatened to literally destroy the United States and every person in its citizenry – to actually develop the nuclear weapons that would allow them to truly make good on their threats to murder us all.

 

The claims of treason against Biden and Harris are no longer hyperbole. Iran (with the direct assistance from the $150 BILLION given to them by Biden and Harris, followed by the additional $6 BILLION they gave them (on SEPTEMBER 11^(TH) last year of all dates!) which has now been proven to have been used to directly finance the palestinians’ October 7^(th) attack of Israel and subsequent attacks since then) has now developed nuclear weapons meant to be used to attack us and our allies (and btw Biden ADMITTED that he knew that at least a portion of the $150 billion they gave Iran would be used to build weapons that would be used to attack us and our allies, and fund terrorism). NOW you understand why President Trump tore up the Iran accord – and was 100% right to do so – as it restricted us from defending our own citizenry while it is was proven that Iran was never abiding by the terms of the accord and simply used OUR MONEY to build weapons to destroy us and our enemies.

Fast forward to now, I’m voting for Trump. We have had a presidency with Trump and we have had a presidency with Biden. The damage that Biden is doing almost feels irreparable.

The point I’m getting at is that I wished Sanders could have been the Democratic president so we had a true chance for socialism. I always had seen sanders as a man of honesty and principle, but Biden is undoubtedly a pathological liar and compromised (laundered money). Intentionally letting in millions of immigrants… with many likely to vote. Life feels unaffordable. And Sanders still endorsed him? Maybe Sanders isn’t the person I thought he was. Idk.

Let me give everyone a quick breakdown of the liberal strategy: 

- change candidates last minute
- get donors to agree to provide money all at once to make it look ""historic"" and that everyone is ""enthusiastic"" about Harris 
- get all of the state run media to manufacture the image of excitement about the candidate
- skew polls to make it seem like voters are excited about new candidate
- use musicians and bus people into rallies to manufacture excitement optics 
- all the while, keep candidate away from media to keep her image up and away from scrutiny 

That's it. It's all fake. A mirage. Look into the polls that have her up. They oversample Democrats by 3-7% or more. PURPOSELY. 

it's to make the other side feel like they are losing. To get people to feel down and in defeat. 

Do you really think that Harris would need to be paying influencers thousands of dollars to attack Trump if her polls were legit?

Do you think she would really avoid the media if she wasn't a house of cards?

The sad thing is, even Republicans are falling for it. Don't be so naive. She's an awful candidate and so is her VP.

It will be our fault for not realizing that they will never be exposed to the truth. It will be our fault for wasting  our time trying to make them aware, to see what we see and know what we know, instead of putting all that effort into getting all of us on the Right to the polls.

Democrats won’t win because they got out their vote. They will win because we failed to get out our vote. That will be the “I told you so” I speak, and it will be directed at  Republicans, not Democrats, and there will be little comfort in it.

Looks like they bit on the info and bit hard!

The whole dossier is actually a poison pill designed to expose the depths of the Mainstream lies and the real collusion between the Dems, the Corporate Media, and (purportedly) bad foreign actors. And wow, they chomped down hard!

Now the poison is flowing everywhere to see, and can’t easily be reeled back in. All because they ran with that one little word that is sprinkled all throughout the “Vulnerabilities” report.

The truth is, outside of his base, Trump is deeply unpopular. All this group think and lying to ourselves is only going to hurt us. And not just this election.

And this is the uber-liberal CNN!

 

BIDEN AND HARRIS’ ECONOMIC POLICIES HAVE LITERALLY DESTROYED THIS COUNTRY.

 

It's not ""corporate price gouging"" that caused the massive inflation we've endured during Kamala's time in office - it was her massive regulations, spending and taxation, which resulted in massive increases in production costs along with the massive draconian devaluation of the dollar due to the government printing money to pay for their egregious spending.

 

She says she can ""fix"" these issues ""once she's in office"", but the problem is that she HAS been in office for the past four years and never ""fixed"" them then, in fact she was the one who caused them.

 

TWO-THIRDS OF THE POPULATION ARE NOW LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK.

 

MEDIAN WAGE HAS FALLEN TO JUST $40,847.18

 

Given the massive inflation that has far outpaced income growth (hence even if you got a raise at work, everyone still got a real cut in salary given that growth in prices exceed any increase in income you may have received) combined with the additional taxes being imposed – PARTICULARLY ON THE MIDDLE CLASS, DESPITE THE PROMISES OF BIDEN, HARRIS AND THE DEMS, we all have less money and less real income – a double whammy!

 

Let’s be clear – inflation has NOT gone down, rather it is still very much increasing, month over month, year over year.  It just isn’t increasing AS MUCH as it was before, given how much damage Biden and the dems have already caused, BUT PRICES ARE STILL VERY MUCH GOING UP across the board.

 

And the reality is that despite what they SAID would happen under President Trump (rampant inflation, $5 gas, economic collapse, loss of global respect, starting World War III, etc.), the country as well as the economy was never in better shape and there were no wars.  ISIS and Al Qaeda were gone; Russia, China and Iran were in check; and the world was far safer because we had a strong and respected leader. Now the terrorists are all back, as are Russia, China and Iran. And inflation, unemployment and crime are rampant. In addition, under President Trump the US reduced carbon emissions more than any country in the Paris Accord. EVERY BAD THING THEY SAID WOULD HAPPEN UNDER TRUMP (NONE OF WHICH EVER OCCURRED) HAS ACTUALLY OCCURRED UNDER BIDEN AND HARRIS.  SO IF YOU WERE OPPOSED TO TRUMP FOR THOSE REASONS WHICH NEVER ACTUALLY OCCURRED, THEN THERE IS ZERO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD EVER VOTE FOR BIDEN, HARRIS OR ANY DEMOCRAT AGAIN.  Unless of course you are just a hypocrite filled with hate and your words mean nothing – and everything that is occurring in this country is very much your fault as well.

 

More Americans are tapping their 401(k) accounts because of financial distress.

 

EVEN THE NON-PARTISAN CONGRSSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE DEFINITIVELY CONFIRMED THAT BIDEN, HARRIS AND THE DEMS ARE TO BLAME FOR INFLATION, NOT PUTIN.

 

AND NO - IT IS NOT BECAUSE OF ""RECOVERY FROM THE PANDEMIC"" - THAT WOULD ONLY BE TRUE IF THE PRICES OF SUCH GOODS WERE NOW AT PRE-PANDEMIC LEVELS, BUT THESE PRICES ARE EXPONENTIALLY HIGHER.

 

INFLATION – INCLUDING GAS PRICES – WAS SOARING WAY BEFORE RUSSIA/UKRAINE. This was a direct result of Biden’s, Harris' and the democrats’ draconian policies, rampant spending, ridiculously prohibitive and expensive regulations, and massive tax increases, and now they are trying to use the war to sweep it under the rug. In addition to the fact that the massive spike in gas prices began way before Russia/Ukraine, inflation on ALL goods had already been soaring throughout the country – food, building materials, gas, consumer goods, etc. – AND NOW THERE IS A FOOD AND A BABY FORMULA SHORTAGE – and NONE OF ANY OF THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA. Yes – gas prices will increase even further now as a result of the war (and only gas – the war has no impact on the prices of any other goods that are now at historical inflationary levels), but they will increase off of an already ridiculously historically high inflationary basis that was in place before the war even began!

 

While President Trump created the GREATEST economy US HISTORY (and the demographic which benefitted the most from President Trump's policies was the Black community), since Biden occupied the White House he and Harris created the WORST economy since the Depression – far worse than the economy he inherited, an economic crisis, an unemployment crisis, a border crisis, an energy crisis (we were completely energy independent under President Trump and didn’t buy our gas from anyone else – GAS PRICES WERE SKYROCKETING UNDER BIDEN’S AND HARRIS’ POLICIES WAY BEFORE RUSSIA/UKRAINE), a foreign policy crisis, terrorist organizations such as ISIS, the Taliban and Al Qaeda have regained strength (and our enemies such as Russia, Iran and China now perceive us as being weak!), crime and murders at an all-time high, a racial crisis, and a country on the brink of civil war. In short – a massive crisis of our democracy as our country has now become a socialist’s haven under fascist rule.

 

Inflation is now soaring – gas prices, consumer products, construction products such as lumber (which has a direct impact on home ownership). We have gone from complete energy independence under President Trump to gas shortages and lines at the pump and complete dependence upon other countries (it seems that we have regressed 50 years back to the 1970s). Unemployment is soaring. Biden’s and Harris’ policies have literally destroyed millions of jobs. This country is on fire (quite literally in a great many cities – and Biden and the dems seem fit to not only allow it to happen, but encourage it, allowing the Antifa/BLM terrorists burning down the cities to go free while going after political enemies with tactics that cannot be described as anything short of gestapo partisan tactics).

 

For those of you who voted for Biden and Harris, do you still not yet see your massive mistake and how you have contributed to the destruction of this country??? This is your doing. Furthermore, the deaths of all those Afghan people - and all of the Americans who will be killed in future terror attacks that would have never occurred under President Trump - is not just on Biden's and Harris’ heads - but yours as well, along with any other ignorant fascist who voted for them.

Surprising results.,"tldr; ChatGPT says: **Degree of Bias**: **The degree of negative bias in Vance’s interview can be considered significant** in comparison to Harris’s interview. The difference lies in the intensity of the questioning, the focus on controversies, and the lack of moments that allow for a more personal connection to the interviewee.

--

Regardless of what you think about AI, if correctly used, I believe it can be a neutral arbiter of questions of bias in humans. Politics is perhaps the most divisive area of our country so I took [this interview]( of Dana Bash and JD Vance and [this interview]( of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz with Dana Bash and uploaded them to ChatGPT asking only:

>

>act as an unbiased expert on media bias, I'm going to give you the transcript of two interviews each conducted by ""BASH"" and I want you to identify any differences between the two interviews that would indicate bias. Are you ready for interview one?

This was ChatGPT's response:

Based on the transcripts you provided, here are some key differences that might indicate bias or differences in approach in the interviews conducted by Dana Bash:

1. **Tone and Confrontation**:
   * **Vance's Interview**: The tone appears more confrontational and challenging, with Bash pressing Vance on various statements and inconsistencies, such as his views on military service, his attacks on opponents, and his alignment with Donald Trump. This interview contains numerous follow-up questions challenging Vance's statements and positions.
   * **Harris's Interview**: The tone seems less confrontational. Bash's questions are direct but less aggressive compared to the Vance interview. The discussion also moves swiftly from potentially sensitive topics, like the comment about Harris ""turning black,"" to policy-focused questions without much probing into personal controversies.
2. **Content Focus**:
   * **Vance's Interview**: There's a significant focus on personal attacks, controversies, and Vance's criticisms of his political opponents, which dominates the conversation. Bash frequently challenges Vance on his previous statements and political positions.
   * **Harris's Interview**: The questions are more centered on policy issues, Harris's personal reactions to political developments, and her stances on international matters. The personal challenges are fewer, and the controversies around Harris are addressed but not dwelt upon extensively.
3. **Personal and Emotional Appeals**:
   * **Vance's Interview**: The interview has moments where Vance's personal life and military service are discussed, but these are often framed within the context of political attacks or controversies.
   * **Harris's Interview**: There's a noticeable inclusion of personal and emotional elements, such as the discussion of Harris's family and the impactful photo of her niece. These moments are presented in a way that humanizes Harris and shifts focus away from purely political or controversial aspects.
4. **Response Handling**:
   * **Vance's Interview**: Bash is persistent in seeking clarifications and pushing back against Vance’s responses, particularly when discussing his criticisms of others and his alignment with Donald Trump.
   * **Harris's Interview**: Bash allows Harris to guide the conversation more, especially in how she wishes to frame her political stances and personal anecdotes. The pushback is notably milder compared to Vance's interview.

These differences could suggest a variance in interviewing style based on the subject's responses or potentially an underlying bias in how each interview is structured and conducted, focusing more on controversy in one and policy in the other. However, the actual intent behind these differences would require further analysis of a broader range of interviews to definitively conclude bias.

I then asked it:

>Based just on these transcripts alone, choose the interview that was more biased negatively and to which degree you see the difference of bias

To which it responded:

Based solely on the transcripts provided, the interview with J.D. Vance appears more negatively biased compared to the interview with Kamala Harris. Here’s a breakdown of how this bias manifests and the degree of difference:

1. **Confrontational Questions**: The interview with Vance features a more confrontational approach with repeated challenges and a focus on controversy. Bash presses Vance on his previous statements, political attacks, and controversies, often using a tone that demands justification and correction of perceived inconsistencies. This contrasts with the Harris interview, where Bash’s tone is more neutral and focused on policy without as much personal or controversial probing.
2. **Focus on Controversy and Attacks**: Vance's interview is heavily centered on his criticisms of opponents and his alignment with controversial figures like Donald Trump. These topics are pursued with persistence and often framed in a manner that seems designed to highlight conflicts and controversies. In contrast, Harris's interview, while it does touch on controversial topics (like her comment about turning black and policy on Israel), quickly moves to broader policy discussions and personal narratives that cast her in a more sympathetic or relatable light.
3. **Emotional and Personal Content**: In Harris's interview, there is a clear effort to humanize her through discussions about her family and emotional moments, which are absent in Vance’s interview. Instead, Vance's personal elements are often linked to political controversies or criticisms, which does not afford him the same personal connection with the audience that Harris receives.
4. **Degree of Bias**: **The degree of negative bias in Vance’s interview can be considered significant** in comparison to Harris’s interview. The difference lies in the intensity of the questioning, the focus on controversies, and the lack of moments that allow for a more personal connection to the interviewee.

These elements combined suggest that the interview with J.D. Vance was conducted in a more negatively biased manner, focusing on controversy and conflict, whereas Kamala Harris’s interview allowed more space for policy exposition and personal storytelling, contributing to a less confrontational and more balanced presentation.

Kamala has to win the popular vote by about 1.5 percentage points to win the general election (i.e. the electoral college), as Trump will win more states. Also, as Trump tends to underpoll for one reason or another, she would probably need to be closer to +3.5 to be truly even.

Harris strengths were more on the social issues of abortion and health care.

Trump’s strengths was on the immigration, the economy, and foreign policy. 

 But considering:
1. the debate was 3 against 1 at times as the moderators pushed back more on Trumps past words than Kamala’s (e.g. flip flopping on fracking, “my values have not changed”)
2. Trump used her own “I’m speaking” line against her to shut her up twice.
3. Trump called her and Biden out for not implementing some of her proposed policies now.

I think Trump had the edge and put up a strong performance.

And after passing a bill outlawing free speech in California, he would make sure no one could make fun of him about it.

His latest proposal would tax the exhaling of more than 3 breaths per minute. As everyone who follows the science knows, humans exhale CO2 (Carbon DiOxide) with every single breath. So decreasing the amount of exhalations would decrease CO2 in the atmosphere.

The proposed bill states that anyone caught exhaling more than 3 times each minute would be taxed for each additional breath. Each successive breath above 3 per minute would double the tax rate. Naturally, there would be tiers. Once someone has used double the amount of the per minute breath exhalation allotment, their tax rate will triple. 

Because California is progressive state, and Governor Newsome has seen all of Kamala Harris' interviews, he has his eyes on the national 2028 scene. To that end, he does not want to be seen favoring those who can financially afford to exhale more often. This would typically include other politicians and Hollywood actors who usually spend a lot of time ""informing"" we plebeians what we should be thinking and how. No, he wants to ensure equality for all.

In that vein, he has included a penalty clause. Anyone caught using triple their per minute breath exhalation rate - on average - for a full 24 hour period would be subject to the penalty clause. This would allow those mothers who are giving birth, athletes who are exercising, as well as  politicians and actors pontificating plenty of time to complete their activities and be taxed accordingly.

The penalty clause would require anyone caught using triple their per minute breath exhalation rate - on average - for a full 24 hour period to have a mandatory 1 hour no exhalation period. To show how compassionate California is, there would be no additional taxes during this no exhalation period.

The CA Dept of Revenue expects initial tax receipts to be in the billions of dollars in the first week with revenues dwindling rapidly as revenue sources somehow diminish and disappear. Revenue agents are uncertain as to what to the causes of these losses may be.

Some question whether the governor can garner the votes for such a proposal. But after hunting down an individual surfer who was alone, and away from everyone during the COVID lockdown, and then putting him in jail with others, nothing seems beyond the capabilities of the California state.

There are some voices of concern, primarily from Orange County. Of all the people interviewed about this proposal, only some Hindu monks in San Francisco stated that they do not believe that they would be impacted by this new law whatsoever.

I'm running on Reproductive Healthcare and VA Reform against a Trump-endorsed MAGA insider who campaigns with Kari Lake and Marjorie Taylor-Greene. AMA!","Hi r/politics!

My name is Maura Keller, and I am the Democratic nominee for Georgia’s 3rd Congressional District.

I am a retired Lieutenant Colonel, serving in the U.S. Army for 26 years after enlisting as an MP at 17. I have also worked as a strategic analyst, taking contracts dealing with the Office of the Chief Army Reserve and the Under Secretary of the Department of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. Most recently, I have worked as a Nuclear Medicine Technologist, spending my last 3 years at the Atlanta VA.

My experiences as a health care worker for our veterans, combined with the fall of Roe v. Wade, was enough for me to quit my job and run for Congress. In Georgia, we desperately need VA reform. After working in the VA health system and seeing firsthand how we mistreat our service members, I know how to make positive changes that prioritize their care. As I like to say: I know where the bodies are buried. We also need immediate protections for reproductive healthcare, a raise in the minimum wage, and so much more.

Yes, I’m running in a red district. But, for the first time ever, we actually have a shot at flipping this seat. [I'm up against Trump loyalist and MAGA sweetheart Brian Jack]( The historical data for this district has gone out of the window. For the first time in years, we have an open seat. Reproductive freedom is on the ballot. We have a large number of Republicans who don't want to support MAGA candidates. It’s time for us all to take a stand in District 3, and all of you can help by spreading this AMA. 

Some of you might think that a woman running on reproductive healthcare in a +37 Trump district that has never elected a woman is a fool's errand. I say we only need to look at Alabama, Ohio, and Kentucky to know the power of running on common sense reproductive healthcare. If you’d like to stay in touch, please join my subreddit r/maurakeller. If you’d like to donate to my campaign, that would be a huge help for us in flipping this seat.

Okay, r/politics. Ask me Anything!

I'm running to replace the ultra-partisan, finger-pointing, extremism with a common-sense, common ground and results oriented approach.","My name is Dave Wagenhauser, and I'm running for Congress in NY-24, a largely rural district in Upstate and Western New York (WNY). I grew up in WNY, raised by a single mother who struggled to raise four kids. I attended SUNY Brockport and later graduated from Syracuse Law School while supporting myself as a painter and carpenter.


After law school, I moved to Washington, D.C., where I became a First Amendment public interest attorney. I crafted bipartisan legislation, testified before the House and Senate, and successfully sued to shut down anti-consumer practices in the telecommunications industry. I eventually returned home to help run my mother's startup, a home care agency serving elderly and disabled people. In recent years, I've served in local offices and taken on staffing roles in other congressional campaigns.


Today, Congress is broken, and so are many of its members. Common sense, hard work, and actual results have been replaced by finger-pointing and insults. You don't need to be an extremist, ultra-partisan, or a conspiracy theorist to be effective in government.

Unfortunately, too many politicians enter office wealthy and leave even richer. It's time to remove the influence of money from our governing process. No more stock trading, corporate PACs, or the Congress-to-Lobbyist pipeline. We need term limits and a renewed focus on public service. I believe in leading by example—I haven't accepted any Corporate PAC or PAC money, and I won't. I will not trade stocks or securities and return home after serving two terms.


Our district is not wealthy. Unlike our current Representative, I know working families and young people can't bear the burden of further tax cuts for billionaires and large corporations. I will work alongside leaders like Senator Casey to combat corporate greed, hold Big Oil and other large corporations accountable for price fixing, and provoke action on the root causes of inflation.


NY-24 is plagued by a significant number of cancer clusters. No surprise, given the numerous Superfund sites, toxic waste dumps, and towering landfills shipped into our towns and villages from NYC and New England. We have poisons and forever chemicals leaching into the vast lakes we use for drinking water, the farmland where we grow our crops, and the air we breathe. I am deeply concerned about how this will deteriorate our struggling ecosystems and, inevitably, the health of my neighbors. From day one, my staff and I will tackle this emergency, which is threatening our national and economic security. 


As I've said, we are made up of many rural communities. Like other similar places across the country, it's filled with hardworking people whose eagerness for pragmatic, common-sense reform is often understated. I am a moderate populist, and our team is on the ground every day. What we found:  Independents, Democrats, and Republicans all know that we can no longer avoid reaching across aisles and work towards urgently needed changes right here at home in the 24th District. 


In contrast, our current Representative, Claudia Tenney, focuses her tenure on moral panics, crafting every appearance on cable news around a mission of attracting headlines that please her big-money donors (she endorses President Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize) and undermine our Democratic systems. She is disconnected from our community and sees us only as a means to power.

I’ve chronicled this presidential election from the beginning – and I’m heading to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. AMA!","Hi! My name is Astead Herndon, and I’m a national politics reporter and the host of the politics podcast, “The Run-Up” at The New York Times — which is a guide for people to understand the 2024 election. 

In 2019, I was the Times campaign reporter for Kamala Harris’s initial presidential run, and last year, I spoke with 75 people, including her, about her tenure as Vice-President for a cover story in the New York Times Magazine. Recently, I also wrote an analysis on her rare opportunity to reintroduce herself to the American public, and why the conditions for the 2024 presidential run are different than four years ago. 

I’ve also covered the presidential campaigns of Joe Biden and Donald Trump – with a specific focus on how the bases of both parties have shifted since 2016. I recently explained the implications of Project 2025 alongside my colleague, Jonathan Swan, and reported from the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Each of these links can be accessed for free, even without a subscription to The New York Times. 

Outside the Times, I’m also a political analyst for CNN, and I was previously a former Washington Bureau and City Hall reporter for the  Boston Globe. 

Ask me anything about how we put together “The Run-Up” episodes, the Democratic and Republican conventions – and what to expect in the final months of the election. 

I’ll answer from 1-3 p.m. ET.

We’re [Julia Terruso] ( and [Aseem Shukla.] ( Julia is The Philadelphia Inquirer’s national political reporter, and is leading our presidential election coverage. Aseem is a data reporter, and spends a lot of his time analyzing political data, including past election results, polls, and demographic information.

With just about two months until Election Day, Pennsylvania and Philly are at the center of the 2024 presidential election and will play a key role in determining which party wins the White House. [We analyzed voting shifts among five key groups – and whether those trends continue or reverse will be key to who wins the state.] (

Those groups, listed in order from the most Republican-leaning to most-Democratic-leaning are:

* **Rural areas,** the state’s least dense and most Republican.
* **Suburban areas,** a growing and politically diverse group of medium-density places surrounding cities.
* **White working-class urban areas,** wavering between Democrats and Republicans.
* **White college-educated urban areas,** a high-turnout bedrock for Democrats.
* **Non-white urban areas,** deep-blue but showing signs of softening on Democrats.

Now, The Inquirer is using [this analysis] ( to visit and write about communities that exemplify these kinds of places. So far, we’ve written about [a township in the suburbs of Philadelphia] ( that has shifted left and the [Latino-majority city of Reading,] ( where Republicans have made gains.
