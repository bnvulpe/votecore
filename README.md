# Correlation Between Online Activity and Political Trends

## Hypothesis

The decline in Donald Trump's popularity, despite an assassination attempt, and the rise of Kamala Harris following Joe Biden's withdrawal are reflected in the activity of North American communities on the most popular political forums on Reddit, both in the number of posts and comments as well as in the sentiment (positive or negative) towards the candidates. These data will be contrasted with the results of voter intention polls and Google searches performed by the American population to draw conclusions about the correlation between online activity and political trends.
