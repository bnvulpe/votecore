### Motivation Overview

- **General Objective of the Project:**  
  The primary goal of this project is to analyze the sentiment towards political candidates by combining various datasets, including social media interactions, polling data, and Google Trends. By integrating these data sources, we aim to better understand public opinion and trends over a specific period leading up to an election. The analysis will focus on uncovering sentiment patterns, fluctuations in candidate support, and possible correlations between public discourse and polling/interest data.

- **Research Questions or Hypotheses:**  

  This study hypothesizes that the support values extracted from Reddit comments and posts for each candidate in two datasets—one comparing Joe Biden and Donald Trump, and the other comparing Kamala Harris and Donald Trump—will show a statistical correspondence between functions with the corresponding poll results from the same timeframe. This would suggest that as sentiment on Reddit shifts positively or negatively for a candidate, polling data will reflect similar trends. Additionally, the study anticipates that sentiment changes on Reddit will correspond positively with Google Trends search volumes for each candidate, indicating that public interest, as reflected by search activity, aligns with sentiment trends on Reddit. These hypotheses aim to demonstrate that online discourse and sentiment can offer valuable insights into broader public opinion and interest, with the potential to predict shifts in support, including scenarios in which Kamala Harris could emerge as a leading candidate in the election context.

  Note that this study is limited to the U.S. public, focusing specifically on the behaviors of predominantly U.S.-based users on Reddit and Google Trends.

  Here are some research questions that we intend on exploring to support the project's objectives and validate the hypothesis:
  **What is the correlation between support values from Reddit posts/comments and polling results for each candidate over the same time period?**
  **How does support for a candidate in Reddit posts/comments vary in relation to key campaign events, and how does this compare to Google search activity?**
  **Do incidents like the assassination attempt, Biden's retirement from politics and arrival of Kamala Harris to the presidential race directly affect the discussion in the online communities, if so, is this also seen in support/interest?**

- **Justification of the Selected Data:**  

  The datasets selected for this project—social media comments and posts, polling data, and Google Trends—are ideal for addressing the research questions because they provide a multi-faceted view of public sentiment. Social media data offers real-time reactions and discussions from the general public, while polling data gives insight into formalized public opinion at regular intervals. Google Trends data reflects spontaneous interest in candidates, which might be linked to specific events or moments of heightened attention. Together, these sources offer complementary perspectives on public opinion.

- **Potential Challenges with the Cleaned Data:**  

  1. **Data Bias:** Social media data, especially from platforms like Reddit, may not be representative of the broader population, as it often reflects the opinions of more vocal or politically active users.

  2. **Insufficient Coverage:** Certain time periods or candidates may have limited data available on social media platforms, particularly in less-discussed events or during quieter periods of the campaign, leading to incomplete coverage.

  3. **Support Analysis Accuracy:** The complexity of political discourse and the presence of sarcasm or ambiguous language may present challenges in accurately capturing supportive or critical sentiment from social media posts.
