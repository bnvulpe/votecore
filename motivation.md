### Motivation Overview
NOT DONE
- **General Objective of the Project:**  
  The primary goal of this project is to analyze the sentiment towards political candidates by combining various datasets, including social media interactions, polling data, and Google Trends. By integrating these data sources, we aim to better understand public opinion and trends over a specific period leading up to an election. The analysis will focus on uncovering sentiment patterns, fluctuations in candidate support, and possible correlations between public discourse and polling/interest data.

- **Research Questions or Hypotheses:**  
  1. **What is the overall sentiment towards each candidate based on social media interactions (comments and posts)?**
  2. **Do fluctuations in social media sentiment correspond to changes in polling data or Google search trends?**
  3. **Can public opinion on social media be a leading indicator for polling data?**
  4. **Are there specific events or periods that lead to significant changes in sentiment or interest in a candidate?**
  
  These hypotheses will help guide the analysis, focusing on understanding how social media activity, public sentiment, and polling data are interrelated.

- **Justification of the Selected Data:**  
  The datasets selected for this project—social media comments and posts, polling data, and Google Trends—are ideal for addressing the research questions because they provide a multi-faceted view of public sentiment. Social media data offers real-time reactions and discussions from the general public, while polling data gives insight into formalized public opinion at regular intervals. Google Trends data reflects spontaneous interest in candidates, which might be linked to specific events or moments of heightened attention. Together, these sources offer complementary perspectives on public opinion.

- **Potential Challenges with the Cleaned Data:**  
  There are a few potential limitations with the cleaned data that need to be considered:
  1. **Data Bias:** Social media data, especially from platforms like Reddit, may not be representative of the broader population, as it often reflects the opinions of more vocal or politically active users.
  2. **Insufficient Coverage:** Certain time periods or candidates may have limited data available, particularly in less-discussed regions or during quieter periods of the campaign, leading to incomplete coverage.
  3. **Data Gaps:** There may be missing or incomplete data points for some days in both polling and Google Trends datasets, which could affect the accuracy of longitudinal analyses.
  4. **Sentiment Analysis Accuracy:** The complexity of political discourse and the presence of sarcasm or ambiguous language may present challenges in accurately capturing sentiment from social media posts.
