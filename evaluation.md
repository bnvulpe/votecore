# A brief comment on evaluation 

In this project, standard metrics were not used to evaluate the results, as traditional metrics are not well-suited to the nature of the data and the chosen analytical approach. Instead of relying on conventional quantitative metrics, the focus was placed on examining the coefficients of the exogenous variables in the ARIMA models, visual trend analysis, and the exploration of topics within Reddit communities. These methods offer a more meaningful interpretation of the relationships between Reddit support, external search trends, and the inherent volatility of the domain under study. The predominantly null results emphasize that the analysis prioritizes understanding the observed trends and patterns over the application of traditional metrics.

The visualization of support values over time being similar to random noise could help explain both the low coefficients and the low-order ARIMA models. When support values, such as Reddit engagement or external search trends, show minimal or erratic fluctuations with no clear patterns or correlations, it suggests that the underlying factors influencing these values are either weak or highly variable. This randomness means that the ARIMA models, which are designed to capture temporal dependencies, detect very little significant structure, resulting in low-order models. A low-order ARIMA model essentially reflects a lack of complex trends or long-term dependencies, supporting the idea that Reddit discussions and related support metrics are more transient and less predictable than initially expected.

Additionally, the low coherence scores obtained during the parameter grid search for SequentialLDA models further reinforce this observation. Coherence values around -2.68 indicate poor topic detection, suggesting that the model struggled to identify meaningful or interpretable topics within the Reddit discussions. Coherence is a metric used to measure the semantic consistency of words within a topic, and low scores imply that the words grouped into a topic do not align well in terms of their contextual meaning or thematic relevance. This could be attributed to several factors, such as the heterogeneity of the data (Reddit comments are highly variable in language, style, and focus), the randomness of online discussions, or the lack of strong, consistent themes within the discourse during the analyzed periods. The weak correlations in the exogenous variables, such as Google searches and polls, also support the idea that external factors were not strongly influencing Reddit discussions, further contributing to the poor topic coherence and suggesting a more diffuse or fragmented discourse. Together, these observations indicate that the analysis reflects complex, noisy data where clear patterns are difficult to extract, leading to low model performance across both time-series and topic modeling approaches.
